I like the hare emblem that this brewery uses for their branding.\\t\\tPoured into a Sam Smith's pint glass. A pale golden colour with little carbonation; just a few bubbles meandering up the centre of the ale. Head is a foamy white and subsides after a minute to leave a surface film. Aroma has some light malt and a distinct buttery note, also a faint notes of leaves. Not the most enticing smell for an ale.\\t\\tInitial taste is of light grainy malt, followed by some bitterness upon swallowing. No clear hop flavours. Again the buttery notes appears, particularly when you breath while drinking. Also a butteriness to the aftertaste, as well as a tinge of corn or stewed veg. Mouthfeel is slightly slick and oily on the tongue.\\t\\tOverall, drinkable but not the best beer. Taste is relatively light and lacking in character, along with some unpleasant off-flavours in the background. I like some other beers I've tried from this brewery, but this can be passed over.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Poured into a standard shaker pint glass as 'cellar floor' temperature. I must admit to surprise and disappointment on the pour. The head seemed to come out as would a carbonated soft drink. The minimal head last less than 30 seconds, and I'm now looking at a glass that has no head or lace. Color is a beautiful hue of red, which offers some saving grace to the appearance. I've noted that others were able to raise some head with theirs, so perhaps I have a bad bottle? I got it right from the brewery a few months ago, so I know its fresh.\\t\\tThe nose is lightly spiced, mostly cinnamon with some malty sweetness mixed in. Again, this bottle is below the standard I expect from beers from this brewer.\\t\\tThe taste definitely offers a cinnamon kick, with nutmeg coming in second, and ginger hardly making a show. A caramel maltiness is next in line, with no hop presence at all. The alcohol is only noticable with the warming as you swallow. I get more bitterness from the spices than from hops, but that is expected for this style. Carbonation seems awfully low ... perhaps the reason I wasn't able to rouse any kind of head. With the low carbonation, the mouthfeel is medium+. Drinkability isn't huge, as the spiciness and rather flat carbonation seem to take the life out of this. I'll finish the bomber, but if I had another, I wouldn't open it .. I'd try to trade it.\\t\\tI've had lots of Hoppin' Frog brews, and most of them are in the 'A' range ... which is why this beer is so puzzling to me. I guess its possible that I just got a bad bottle that had a poor cap seal, and it decarbed over the 3 months that I've had it. Nonetheless, this was a huge Christmas disappointment. I wouldn't necessarily base your judgement of this beer on this review, because this is definitely not typical of this brewery. If you get a chance to pick one up, do so, as this bottle has to be an anomaly.\\t\\tNa Zdravje!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Bottle courtesy of badnewsbeers. Live review.\\t\\tOhh, and just for Ryan, this review is entirely droided. \\t\\tThe appearance is really lackluster. No bubbles, no head, no foam, nada. The color is an amber with pinkish hues.\\t\\tThe smell begins with lots of bourbon notes. Vanilla and oak are big, along with a harsh alcohol astringency. As it warms the beer grows exponentially in deliciousness. Maple begins to come through, though it never becomes super apparent. Brown sugar and toffee round out the aroma with a pleasant sweetness.\\t\\tThe taste also really benefitted from some warmth. There's a sweetness that is slightly citrus in nature, along with lovely bourbon flavors. It grows in bitterness over time, to the point where I must assume that this was heavily hopped. Additionally, wheat or no wheat I feel like there could be some rye in the grain bill as well.\\t\\tSpicy orange peel and peppery alcohol lead into complex malt flavors. Vanilla is very big as is caramel and tobacco leaves. \\t\\tQuite boozy, this is a sipper. I kind of wonder if Founders didn't fudge the 12% abv listing on this... very low carbonation, I was wanting at least a little more.\\t\\tOverall - I finally get why everyone raved about how much better the '09 was compared to the '10. I want more.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'For BEER REVIEW #100(!), which just so happened to fall on New Years Eve, I thought I\\'d bust out something special from the cellar...\\t\\tReviewing the infamous Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) from Founders Brewing Company.\\tScore: 98\\t\\t2011 vintage bottle served in an oversized brandy snifter glass.\\t\\tAppearance: Jet black color, 100% opaque. No light cuts through this stuff. Pours two fingers of creamy tan/cocoa colored head that very slowly settles into a half finger. Amazing, sticky lacing. 5/5\\t\\tSmell: Coffee and creamy chocolate. Some fig and maple with muted marshmallows/vanilla. Roasted chocolate aromas come out as the beer warms, and caramelized/burnt brown sugar smells become apparent as the amount of beer in the glass dwindles. 4.5/5\\t\\tTaste: Very balanced and delicious. Smooth maple and mellow bourbon up front. Lots of creamy chocolate thereafter. Lots of smooth syrupy flavors without the syrupy stickiness/thickness. Lingering maple/chocolate flavor. Increasing amounts chocolate and raisins as it layers. Definitely getting dark fruit on the mid-palate. 10.6% ABV is completely hidden. The flavors are not super intense, but they are amazing. 5/5\\t\\tMouthfeel: Full-medium bodied with the perfect minimal level of carbonation. Viscous and velvety, like melted chocolate (only lighter on the palate). The flavor of this beer absolutely coats the palate. Finish is sweet. 5/5\\t\\tOverall: While I would not call CBS my favorite beer (that honor still belongs to either Surly Darkness or Goose Island Bourbon County Stout), it is an absolutely fantastic, must-try brew. Truly \"world class.\" There is a reason that this brew is universally recognized as one of the best beers in the world.\\t\\tRecommendation: A must-try stout for beer geeks and casual beer drinkers alike. Highly recommend people try this one.\\t\\tFood pairings: This one is a dessert in and of itself, and should be enjoyed as such. Maybe you could pair it with waffles.\\t\\tCost: $7.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle.',\n",

Since it's a Founders brew, I will assume it has a good look with a nice head and good retention. Smell was quite surprising for a porter with lots of carmel and burnt sugar notes. Perhaps a touch of mocca which was a pleasant addition. Great smell overall. Taste followed the nose with the carmel and coffee/mocca thing. Picked up some molasses on the end with just enough hops/bitterness to round it out. Solid. Feel was nice and heavy like a good porter should feel. Not too chewy, but nice and hearty with some decent carbonation. Overall- A very enjoyable porter and good representation of the style. Strong aroma with a thick feel and complex taste. Will be having another at some point in the near future. Very tasty-\",\n",

Bottled on 10/21/11. \\t\\tInspired to pull this one out of the back of the fridge after a long monday back from the Thanksgiving weekend. \\t\\tA: Hazy, translucent orange glow, developed a half inch head and left spotty lacing down the glass as it went. \\t\\tS: Fruity, citrusy hops. Sweet-smelling.\\t\\tT: That's why I wanted an IPA after the day I had! Doesn't waste time with the flavor profile. Robust hop taste...but maltier than I expected. Not what I necessarily prefer in an IPA, but the hops taste is prominent enough not to matter a lot. Warm, vapory alcohol taste in the back of the throat on the way down. For the first half of the glass, the alcohol was noticeable, but I must have become acclimated to the alcohol as it was nearly unnoticeable by the bottom of the glass. However, for me the alcohol taste was as much present as the hops throughout the glass. \\t\\tM: Warm, moderate carbonation, easy going down. Very light slick texture. \\t\\tO: Not bad, but what I will take away most is the distraction from the hops by the alcohol and malt. I can think of a few other IPAs I would go to before this one, but I wouldn't turn it down either.\",\n",

Doesn't get much better than this.\\t\\tSmell, which pours out of the bottle when you pop the cap, has coffee and chocolate up front, with strong bourbon notes and dark roasted malts. As it warms up the bourbon starts to come out more, with a nice sweetness in the background. Amazingly smooth and rounded for a loaded, barrel-aged imperial stout.\\t\\tBeen awaiting this first sip for a long time. Here we go. The bourbon is the first thing that hits, but it's not overpowering like it is in so many barrel-aged beers. Next come the smooth dark malts and a bit of chocolate, in a smooth transition. Finish has some bitter coffee. A touch of warming alcohol on the back end, but you have to look for it. The flavors bounce around in the mouth, coming in little mini-waves. As with many of my favorite beers, there are a lot of different things present here, but they all fit together quite well, with no single flavor dominating. I let it warm up a bit, and the bourbon came with a wallop. So in the future, I'm going to drink it a bit on the cold side to enjoy the other flavors.\\t\\tWow this is thick. It has a chewy, almost sludgy character, but still feels rather frothy and light in the mouth. Quite surprising. It doesn't feel like it coats and lingers as much as many thicker stouts do, but the flavors remain and continue to assert themselves for quite a while.\\t\\tAn all-around standout imperial stout. Great balance of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts (in that order), in both the nose and the mouth. This one lives up to its billing. I could drink quite a few, if it wouldn't knock me out. And btw, where's the alcohol? I don't even notice it.\",\n",

Highly effervescent 2-finger head settles fast and leaves little to no lacing on the glass. \\t\\tS: I\\'m fighting to smell anything but smoke in this. Immediately brings to mind smoked cheese. Interesting, if not too much.\\t\\tT: As expected, smoke overwhelms the flavor profile, but dies down just enough for the sweet and clean doppelbock flavors to shine. Skunky hops lend this beer a pleasantly bitter finish, and offset the smoke nicely.\\t\\tM: Carbonation is moderate; body is low. Fits the style, I suppose.\\t\\tO: I tried to rate this to style, but in the end I think it comes down to the fact that I\\'m truly not a fan of smoked beers. I\\'ve tried their marzen (which some people rave over) and ended up pouring it down the drain.

       "  'review/text': 'I picked this beer up at the down town Spec\\'s a week or so ago. This brewer is new to Texas, and I always have a soft spot for a DoppelBock. Let\\'s se what Utah thinks a DoppelBock tastes like:\\t\\tAppearance: Pours a very clear dark brown color with very little of the Red highlights that you would expect for a DoppelBock of this hue. The head was going fast, and was disappearing as fast as I aggressively poured the beer. After a minute, the beer was quite still looking. There is no lacing at all, but I wasn\\'t really expecting any. At least the beer isn\\'t cloudy, but it doesn\\'t look much like a Bock.\\t\\tAroma: The aroma was clean...WAY too clean. There are no melanoidins in here at all, like they didn\\'t even put any of the actual malt in the grain bill. I wasn\\'t expecting a triple decoction, but it would be nice to have some...like they at least tried to hit the style. There is some dark caramel malt in there, and reserved hops like there should be, but it is coming across more like an amped up Vienna that may have some adjuncts in there to be able to achieve the 8% ABV. I am not impressed so far, and Bocks are my favorite style. This beer is missing a heck of a lot of complexity on the malt side to be a real player in this style.\\t\\tTaste: The flavor tries to make up for the lack of complexity by giving you sweetness to coat the palate and that\\'s about it. The beer is quite cloyingly sweet in that it leaves a burnt toffee flavor to linger on the back of the palate for what seems like forever after the sip. The body is medium to full with low carbonation, so the beer has a bit of a hard time making it over the tongue to the belly, so it kindof oozes its way down. The hops might have been forgotten in this beer. I am not one to over hop beers, but this one doesn\\'t give you any hop character at all in the flavor or the finish.\\t\\tOpinion: Well, if you read my review, you would know that this beer disappointed me. I am really critical of this style as this is what I primarily brew and drink, but I regularly drink the classic examples. I live in Texas, where the origin of this mis-guided \"Bock\" characterization has occurred, so I am no stranger to drinking a Brown Lager that has the words \"Bock\" printed on the side of the bottle. You don\\'t typically find that with a brewer that will print \"Double Bock\" on the bottle, but that is what you have with this beer. It is the same Americanized \"version\" of the Bock style, but the alcohol is cranked up a bit, so I guess they printed Double on the side. I will stick to my Weihenstephaner Korbinian and leave this on the shelves for someone who just wants a quick buzz with no real Bock flavor.',\n",

I can smell the original sweetness of the malt wort, but it is balanced well with bitternes.\\t\\tT = Strong smoke flavor, mostly of oak but also some fruit scents, possibly apple, the malt sweetness is there in the middle taste and the finish is long and consists ot betters and smoke. I would like to try this with a good cigar (maybe the new Churchill series of Davidoff) after dinner. I think it would pair very well.\\t\\tM = Relatively light given the strong smell but no more than is to be expected from a lager, even an urbock.

And given that it's a mega brew (being a SABMiller brand) it's quite an accomplishment. There is plenty of taste and a decent balance to boot.\\t\\tIn the pour we find a strikingly clear golden colored lager. Not much head and almost no lacing either - but the color is pleasing nonetheless. The smell, while on the weak side plus being being somewhat floral and slightly sweet, might lead you to believe this is going nowhere fast. But in the taste we find depth - especially for a megabrew. Lots of sweetness up front, immediately balanced out by the carbonation and very floral hoppiness. What follows is a nice smooth body and mouthfeel which is done just right. \\t\\tIt makes drinking this one easy and your first glass will be gone before you know it. Pour a second and let it warm a little so you can enjoy it again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I acquired this tasty beverage from a friend who picked it up for me on his way through Kentucky. Having previously tried a Bourbon Barrel Ale (which I plan to \"officially\" taste and review in a day or two), I couldn\\'t wait to sample my first barrel-aged stout. And I\\'m not disappointed with the results.\\t\\tAppearance -- Deep, dark brown -- almost as close to pitch black as I\\'ve seen in a beer (Sam Smith\\'s Imperial Stout seems slightly darker to me, if memory serves). A fairly vigorous pour yields a one-finger, dark khaki head which quickly recedes. Lacing is non-existent, which isn\\'t a problem for me when it comes to this style. Slightly off-putting, though, were the chunks of what I assume was woody sediment floating in the beer. I waited for these to settle before drinking (not that they\\'d hurt me, I guess). \\t\\tSmell -- Standard stout aroma, marked by chocolate, toasted malt, and a hint of burnt wood (likely from the charred oak barrels used to condition the brew). I get a healthy waft of butterscotch/caramel, with a faint wisp of vanilla -- I attribute this to the bourbon. \\t\\tTaste -- If I wasn\\'t expecting bourbon presence, I\\'d have given this a 4.5 as a stout. I taste mostly the usual stout flavors, led by dark chocolate, toasted malt, and some burnt woodiness. There is SOME bourbon character, which follows the nose precisely: butterscotch/caramel and vanilla are detectable, but not totally in harmony with the stout backbone.\\t\\tMouthfeel -- Significantly lighter-bodied than I hoped/anticipated, this one clearly falls on the \"thin\" side of the stout spectrum. Still, it\\'s certainly no pilsner. A slightly oily finish coats the mouth and throat, and I kind of like it, as this enables the faint bourbon flavors to linger on the palate. \\t\\tDrinkability -- If this stuff is really 8.50% abv, then it may be the best-hidden 8.50% I\\'ve ever experienced. The alcohol is totally undetectable. I\\'m considering having a second bottle of this stuff just to see if I think it\\'s really that strong a brew. Very easy-drinking, substantial in the stomach, and ultimately satisfying. If only the bourbon flavor was just a little more prominent, this would approach perfection.\\t\\tThanks, Bluegrass Brewing Company! Now I just need to find some more bourbon-barrel stouts for comparison!',\n",

It's not like most American smoke beers, however, that drink like liquid bacon (not that that's a bad thing). This flavor is rich with smoked wood flavor more in line with what you get in home-made jerkey - it's a big, but smooth roasted taste that reminds you of a fireplace. The malt provide sweet, crust and caramel background, but mostly just props up the smoked beechwood. The body, despite the strong flavor, is very drinkable. Overall, this is a classic rauchbier.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '22 oz bomber poured into Hoppin\\' Frog pint glass.\\t\\tHad this last year when it first came out and loved it, and was eager to try this year! The fact that this beer just won the GABF Gold Medal in the style is pretty impressive for my hometown HF boys....congrats \"Frog\\'s\"! I am a big fan of Pumpkin beers in general and have tried like 30 of them...think there may be room at some point for a separate category for the newer, more potent Double or Imperial Pumpkins which have cropped up over the past few years...the differences between one like this and a \"regular pumpkin\" like Shipyard Pumpkin or Buffalo Bills, are quite prounced, and akin to the differences between a regular IPA and DIPA....anyway, I digress...\\t\\tBeer poured nice copper / orange color, head pretty light and nice carbonation...smell is pretty yummy, lots of spices, esp. cinnamon and the ginger is in there pretty strong, I like it!\\t\\tTaste is pretty delicious IMO, really a nicely balanced brew that pulls off the delicate malt / hop / spice mix in a nice way, really quite good.\\t\\tMouthfeel is also good, slight alcohol / ginger burn at the end, body is a little light, but that makes it drinkable to me, if too heavy / sweet like many other Imp Pumpkins out there (i.e. ST Pumking), then that makes it not as drinkable, I think they pulled off another winner with this one!\\t\\tI put a few of these aside in my cellar last year, along with some other heavier pumpkins, so will be interesting to sip alongside the new release for 2010 to see how they stack....nice job once again, Hoppin\\' Frog!',\n",

The flavor is big herbal hop blast with the fruitiness showing up towards the middle of the flavor. The after taste is strong and bitter. A very complex hop taste with the dank basement taste paired with flowery herbs and a citrus edge. Mouth feel is fine and this beer is truly a DIPA in that it's surely twice as big and bitter.\",\n",

Produced a good off-white head that dissipated to bubbles after leaving behind some tiny bits of webbing behind. \\t\\t(S)- Some light berry fruits with a toffee, fig, and a woodiness mixed together to create an interesting aroma. Definitely some smokiness present from those oak barrels. \\t\\t(T)- Wow, great dark berry fruits, fig, raisin, cocoa & vanilla. Some cola-ish nuances that remind me of Dr. Pepper. A silky woodiness that has a slight smoky/mineral characteristic. Fantastic Complexity and character to it. \\t\\t(M)- Great carbonation level with a great body to it. There is a slight warming sensation as it goes down, but otherwise the 10.2% abv is integrated very well. Sweet, but in a balanced way. The fruits & wood counterbalance the sweetness well. \\t\\t(D)- A very good beer. I was expecting something extremely potent (it is!) but in a much more delicate/complex sense. The oak bourbon barrels really makes this brew shine. If it tastes this good fresh, this should be really interesting with a year of age on it. Well done, once again Founders!',\n",

Poured from a bomber.\\t\\tAppearance: A pretty dark and cloudy brown (almost like a thick instant iced tea?) with a thick 2+ finger head that is light tan (almost a cinammon color) with pretty solid retention; lots of sediment floating through the body and sitting on the bottom of the glass.\\t\\tSmell: Caramel, raisins, some candied fruits and spices.\\t\\tTaste: Strong caramel presence and a fair amount of maltiness; strong presence of raisins and the candied fruits and the spiciness really becomes much more presrent -- I would say coriander and nutmeg; it's sweet and tart all at the same time.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Relatively dry; moderate carbonation but still fairly smooth. Leaves a funny aftertaste in the mouth, but I can't quite put my finger on what it is. \\t\\tDrinkability: Moderate. It's kind of a heavier beer in the body and the flavors weren't quite as balanced as I've had in some other Belgian darks. Not bad overall, but I feel like I was a little too excited about coming across this in the bottle. Oh well.\",\n",

Very creamy sweet caramel with a little toffee and vanilla along with a nice oak character. Just a little heat (11.2, really?!) completes the bourbon aroma, and that is all backed up with a big smooth chocolate, a little biscuit, and finally some freshly roasted coffee beans. The coffee didn't really take center stage for me, but rather acted as a bridge for the other aromas, well played Founders. \\t\\tT-Coffee and chocolate are a little more prevalent here with the bourbon taking a back seat, but it does come out after a second with some sweet brown sugar and caramel notes, vanilla, and just a touch of oak. For me the flavor was kind of a reversal of the smell, smell was bourbon first, then beer, the flavor was beer then bourbon. I started to get a little more heat here, still not on pace for what it actually is, but again it reminded me more of an actual bourbon. \\t\\tM-Very low carb, super creamy and smooth, very nice.\\t\\tD-One of the best I have had, I felt like everything was incorporated very nicely, and the ABV is hidden very very well. I recently had Peruvian Morning (great beer, don't get me wrong) but I feel like Founders did a much better job using the coffee to add complexity, rather that just adding another ingredient. This beer truly lived up to the hype.\",\n",

The body is densely translucent, burnt orange color with a 2-fingered head of fluffy, lumpy sea foam.

       "  'review/text': 'Clear, pale gold in hue, shiny, there is loads of animation raced towards a fluffy white head. The head at the maximum was three fingers in height; the retention was fair, at best. In a few moments the head had fell to a small, bubbly cap of a half finger, later it turned into a collar. The color is really intriguing. There was no subsequent lacing. I really like the bouquet. The aroma is malty upfront, like a good Pilsner. Then the nose becomes undeniably Belgium! I adore the fruitiness; it is peachy with zippy citrus notes, oranges, and some tropical fruit. Hints of sugar too. The hops are noticeable as well; they seem to impart a firm, bitter, crispness. Suggestions of mint once it warmed significantly. The potency is good and it gets the point across easily, even though the aromas are not that loud but plenty soothing. It is both intriguing and inviting. I cant wait to drink up! So I do. The palate impressed me on my first sip. The maltiness is tasty and firm; plus it is perfectly balanced with the hop bitterness. These features provide a wonderful foundation for the multiple, subtle complexities. Said complexities are an enormous amount of fruitiness largely of peaches, lemons (not tart), oranges, and sugary tropical fruit. There are also some stand alone, sugary flavors. Yum. But there is still more, hints of mint and maybe even coriander? I am deeply impressed with this beer. It is not big and bold but very tasty, it reminds of New Belgium Loft, only much better on all accounts. The modest abv makes this even more attractive. The carbonation is big and active, lovely; the body is medium in bulk. As a whole the mouthfeel is very pleasant and amazingly fitting for the style, err, this beer. The bubbles tickle! Greg at Johns Grocery in Iowa City recommended La Binchoise Blonde Ale to me (good call)! The next time I see this beer I am stocking up. I am baffled why there are so few reviews! Highly Recommended!',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'No head, clear deep orange. Very fuelic alcohol nose. Huge malt and hops, no surprise there. While it doesnt try to be balanced, I dont think it tries to be a total joke. Im sure it takes good skill to make such a beer without it being cloying and abrasive and I know Founders definitely do have great skill, but Id hoped theyd use it to greater purposes than joining a childish weener measurement contest through IBUs and alcohol. Cheap scotch reminiscent alcohol nature, very hot citric hops, earthy, caramelic and apricot like. Hot and abrasive palate, like a Chinook hop shot. Highly astringent, but who cares, its flavourful eh? Woody, minty. Ni drinkability which I expect to have a minimum of in a pale ale. Medium-thick bodied, syrupy. Purposeless heavyweight lost child. No worse than that, a 700 lbs man who cant get up from his bed. Thanks Mike for sharing though, yes Im happy to have tried it, but I sure wouldnt have been able to go through a whole bottle.',\n",

Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Hoppin' Frog pint glass...\\t\\tA - Pours just about completely black and opaque. A big frothy eggshell white/tan head forms about 2 fingers thick. Retention is quite nice.\\t\\tS - Big floral hop aroma right up front. Fruity notes come with the floral notes and then the roasted malts come into play. But here, the hops really seem to take charge of the nose.\\t\\tT - Hmmm. Interesting flavors mixing together. Roasted malts and some slight chocolate mixed with citrus and fruity hops. Not the best mixing I've ever had. The bitterness and sourness/citrus don't really feel like they are mixing too well together. \\t\\tM - Smooth and silky mouthfeel but the roastiness and the hoppiness don't really get along too well on the palate. Carbonation is higher than expected.\\t\\tO - While I appreciate what this beer is, I think the two beers mixed together are better served in their own bottles. Nice to try, but not my favorite offering from this great brewery.\",\n",

Thick sheets of barely broken lace grace the glass as the foam fades.\\t\\tThe aroma is oddly underpowered. Hops are scarce (naturally), but malt should be making more of an impact. Once the head thins even more, the beer begins to smell like a Scotch ale should: caramel malt mostly. Here's hoping the flavor is bolder and better.\\t\\tHoppin' Frog Outta Kilter Wee Heavy Scotch Style Red Ale is a good, though overly simple, version of the wee heavy style. It also tastes less 'dark' and sweeter than most. A lack of smoky peatiness is a slight negative, but it helps if you don't expect an authentic Scottish-like Scotch ale and just concentrate on whether or not it tastes good. Which it does.\\t\\tThe flavor profile includes melted caramel-toffee with a glancing blow of toasted nuttiness, brown sugar syrup, sweetened tea leaves and an orange and apricot fruitiness that sets it apart. This really is enjoyable beer in spite of its deviation from the style guidelines. Hey Fred, if you're listening... I wouldn't change a thing.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is incredibly silky smooth with no rough edges whatsoever. It isn't the most full 8.2%'er in the craft beer world, but it delivers a light nougat-like chewiness that makes every mouthful pure pleasure.\\t\\tForget the smell score because it pulls the total score down too far.

This is disgustingly full of butter. It is like I dropped my crab meat in the bowl of butter and just licked it off instead of eating the meat. Full on nasty. \\t\\tThere are some sour, acetic notes towards the middle with hints of bourbon sweetness making me think this is infected. I don't know exactly, but it has to be. No one would release a beer like this. It dies off quickly but the memory haunts me. I barrel forward with ticking in my heart.\\t\\tOral Sensations\\tCringe worthy. Mild body, smooth, and low carbonation. The flavors are what ruins this beverage. I'm glad it is relatively clean at the ending with everything going to baseline quickly. \\t\\tConclusions\\tMy god... no... never.. not in a million years. Someone will have to test this first before I even get near it. The flavors and aroma are so sickening I feel nausea coming on. I can't even stomach the idea of drinking it right now.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This is a review on the 2009 edition with the bottle simply labeled \"KBS.\" The ABV listed on the bottle is 11.2%, with 70 IBUs. Bottle poured into a snifter after sitting out of the fridge unopened for about 20 minutes. \\t\\tAppearance: Pours extremely dark brown with a finger of rich tan head that fades quickly and retains at a skim. No clarity to this beer, though slight carbonation runs through it visibly in the pour. Light lacing clings here and there down the glass. \\t\\tSmell: Delicious aromas of chocolate, nutty coffee, charred oak and cream and not so delicious aroma of rubbing alcohol. I\\'m sure it\\'s a feature of the bourbon, but I\\'ve had a lot of bourbon barrel beers, and this is definitely less distillery and more doctor\\'s office. \\t\\tTaste/Mouthfeel: I hate to say this, but I\\'m really let down. The rubbing alcohol smell is incredibly bold in the flavor as well. I like bourbon straight up, but all I\\'m getting in this beer bourbon-wise are the alcohol fumes that remain after swallowing. There\\'s little to no indication of the sweet or oak flavors in bourbon. I can taste a charred presence, and the sweet backbone of the hershey\\'s syrupy regular breakfast stout can still be discerned from the aging. The flavors of the coffee are more nutty than roasty, which is nice, and there\\'s a creamy note that\\'s somewhat vanilla, somewhat ice cream. All the really nice flavors are sadly followed by an overwhelming alcohol vapor in the aftertaste with a considerable drying effect. The hops are also noted in the aftertaste more than in the initial swig - the bitterness hangs around in the back of the palate. The mouth is pleasant - really well carbonated, lending a rich feel and volume to the beer. It\\'s definitely viscous and chewy - quite huge altogether. \\t\\tDrinkability: Moderate for style - waaay too hot right now. I had trouble getting through a GI BCS, and this is much hotter. My cheeks are flushed, and I\\'m literally breathing fumes and warm through my stomach. I have heard before that this isn\\'t such a great beer for aging, but I\\'m hoping a few years will take some of the heat off it. \\t\\tI really do love bourbon-barrel beers, and I\\'ve always heard the greatest reviews of this beer. I was told recently that this year\\'s batch from Founders was slightly changed from the past (accounting for the higher ABV, etc). If that\\'s true, I\\'ll be in the market for an older bottle so I can taste what all the original rage was about - this one just isn\\'t cutting it. It\\'s not awful - still quite drinkable really - but it\\'s not the amazing beer I had fully expected Founders to put out. :(',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Into a tulip, Cerise pours a dark pink with just a thin layer of fizzy head. Appearance is somewhat cloudy although sediment isn't readily visible. \\t\\tWhile there is a bit of tart cherry up front the prevailing scent is one of damp, dank basement. Kind of off-putting to say the least.\\t\\tNot as bad as the smell would indicate but it seems an awkward marriage of flavors. The malt body is vaguely biscuity making me think Founders used an ESB or pale ale recipe for the base. The cherries kind of clash with this producing a beer slightly medicinal in nature. Still, the initial cherry flavor is fresh and tart. I just think a more traditional wheat base may have worked better.\\t\\tMouthfeel is actually nice and spritzy without being overcarbonated, a welcome attribute in fruit beers. I still don't think I'd want more than one of these, however.\\t\\tEDIT: as it warms the cherry flavor really shines through nicely making for a much more drinkable and pleasant brew.\",\n",

Chocolate, vanilla, syrup, no hops, alot of malt, that's black biscuit folks.\\t\\tM- Very full and chewy, very sweet, almost reminded me of a few Southern tier beers in taste and feel. With that said this was a bit to sweet for my taste.

It seemed a bit big in sweetness and the maple kind of dominated leaving me trying to find some true old ale flavors.

       "  'review/text': 'Cerise is crystal clear and a berry stained copper color. It\\'s an interesting color. It\\'s topped with a white head that has a slight pink tint. Carbonation looks very active and the head disappeared quickly. Light, sticky lacing lined the glass.\\t\\tThe nose is not very good at all. It predominantly smells sour and yeasty. I\\'m not liking it. There\\'s a faint cherry or berry fruit scent to it. It doesn\\'t smell sweet at all. I was expecting otherwise. Grain and earthy notes are present. Malts are noted on the back end, but still don\\'t add much in terms of sweetness. No alcohol is noted. This one isn\\'t working very well thus far. \\t\\tThe flavor does start out a little sweet interestingly enough. Sour cherries quickly follow and resonate throughout. Grain and earthy flavors are secondary and add quite a bit in terms of beer flavor. Generally, I\\'m not a big fan of fruit/vegetable beers simply because they don\\'t have enough of a \"beer\" flavor. There\\'s enough here to drive it above average. The sour flavor amplifies and has an interesting effect. It really lends some lambic-like qualities to it overall. It is malty and sweet throughout. Sweeter than I expected. It\\'s above average for the style.\\t\\tCerise has a light medium body that\\'s pretty smooth. Carbonation is active, but somehow doesn\\'t interfere with the feel too much. Drinkability is pretty average for me personally. The flavor\\'s alright, but it\\'s a little sour and has too strong of a cherry flavor for me. One 12 ounce is way more than enough in a sitting.\\t\\tCerise is an above average fruit/vegetable beer. Overall, it\\'s okay and has enough beer-like qualities to pass the laugh test. Frankly, I\\'m not a big fan of cherry and this was a little over the top for me. At the end of the day, it\\'s a little better than I expected. While I\\'ll never be a big fan of either, I prefer Rbus to this. I guess I\\'m just more of a raspberry than a cherry fan. Meh. It\\'s worth a try.',\n",

What little head there was disappeared very quickly. It smells very nice, like coffee, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. The taste is mainly chocolate malt, with some roasted coffee flavor too. There's a bitter aftertaste that stays around a while after drinking the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, but this is a very drinkable beer. I'd recommend this to anyone to drink, it's a good selection from BBC. I remember having it on tap a few years ago at the BBC brewpub, so I think I'll have to make another trip to Louisville and try it on tap again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Continuing on my recent scotch ale bender I decided to get my fix with this crazy bastard tonight. I am a huge fan of the orginal dirty bastard, so lets see how it's barrel aged brother turns out. Picked up a single of this at a random beer store in Cadillac MI, for $3. 2010 Vintage. Poured from a 12oz brown stubby bottle into Imy chalice.\\t\\tA- I love the label on this beer, the old hermit looking logger gives this beer a real backwoods vibe. This is one good looking brew, it poured coppery red color that looks really nice when held to the light. It had two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin layer that left a little lacing. One of the best looking beers I have had.\\t\\tS- Wow, this brew smells pretty sweet. I pick up some sweet roasted malts, dark fruits, coffee, and a lot of Bourbon in this brew, no mistaking this for dirty bastard.\\t\\tT- Again, wow! Upfront this beer is all about the bourbon, but its not over powering and it works really nice in contrast with the large amounts of sweet caramel malts in this brew. I can still pick up some of the normal scotch ale flavors like dark fruits but the oak, vanilla and bourbon flavors stick out the most. Great balance in this brew.\\t\\tM- Medium bodied, creamy, and good carbonation.\\t\\tD- Every time I take a sip of this beer i find it hard to believe that it's 10.2%, it goes down like it has the same amount as dirty bastard. I don't think I would drink more then one of these since I enjoy taking my time and sipping it. Great job at hiding the booze in this one.\\t\\tOverall this was one excellent brew and I loved every sip of it. Being such a big fan of dirty bastard I didn't know how this beer was gonna stack up, but I should have known better, if founders puts it out as a seasonal you know its got to be kick ass, and it was. I had a scotty karate yesterday and loved the scotch flavors it had and I thought that the bourbon flavors worked just as well if not better. It seems now a days that stouts and wild ales get all the barrel aging fun but I feel scotch ales need to join in, this style really lends itself to barrel aging. Damn founder's, you guys are awesome, keep making great beers.\",\n",

Absolutely no lacing of the glass. A perfect way to describe this is to imagine draft A&W rootbeer in a glass. Exact same color and the head behaves the same.\\t\\tS - Dark pitted fruits dominate the nose. Deep caramel malts. No hop aroma. The smell doesn't reveal much about this beer. I think I am ready for the next step.\\t\\tT - Dark fruits and heavy heavy caramel malt flavor. The finish is clean and then the roasty flavor hits you. Although the carbonation is light in this beer it really bites your tongue in the front. Hops offer a bitter balance to the caramel malt sweetness, but he malts win the battle. Alcohol heat is apparent after a few sips.\\t\\tM - Thick, maple like with a cabonation bite. This is a pretty chewy beer.\\t\\tDrinkability - Well I don't know who would knock more than one of these back in a session. It is a pretty big beer and heavy on the boom boom. I really like it but I tend to favor small beers rather than the high gravity.\",\n",

More smokiness hits the nose as it warms. Very woodsy and earthy. Interesting! \\tMouthfeel is creamy, and has a charred oak feel. Charcoal certainly comes to mind.\\tVery much an old ale in taste. Malty toffee is nice and sweet, but tastes burnt(in a pleasant way). Boozy Scotch and Bourbon, with a hint of good Brandy. Oak woodsiness adds interest, and there is a nice bitter hops presence that is earthy and woodsy. Overripe McIntosh apples provide the fruity component here, almost overly bitter and near rotten(but not). Very nice execution.\\tThis one really shows a lot of complexity at room temperature. Very nice sipper. The smokiness evokes the taste of burning a caramel apple over an outdoor campfire, deep in the Upper Penninsula woods. Age a few of these and save for deep winter!!

BA files this under Rauchbier, but the bottle says Doppelbock (worth mentioning)\\t\\tPours a nice golden hue, very clear, off white, very bubbly head. Thick, very smokey aroma. Similar to the mikkeller smoked oatmeal stout I had a few weeks ago. Hints of smoked meat and a wee bit of honey. Not as smokey-sweet as some of the other beers in this lineup. \\t\\tThe first sip presents a battle between a honey flavor and the smoked malt. Very silky smooth, but full bodied texture. I'm starting to tasted some of that 'doppelbock' flavor in the malt. I guess this is a smoked version of the style. The hop bite blends with the smoke and the palish malt. It takes the beer to breath a bit before you can taste the hops. \\t\\tThis is a complex beer, although the sweet and smoked flavors dominate. Extremely enjoyable. I love this brewery's consistency and integration of the smoked malt into all their beers.\",\n",

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch tan head. The head didn't stick around for too long, and there isn't much lacing either. Aroma is smoked and roasted malt, chocolate, oak, vanilla and bourbon. Taste is similar to the aroma, all of the flavors are pretty well balanced as the bourbon taste in the beer isn't overpowering at all. There's also a nice lingering smoky finish. I wish there was a little more of a bourbon taste in this brew, but that's a very minor complaint as it's still pretty tasty. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is great, it's very smooth and easy to drink. Hopefully O'Fallon will make this beer more often!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This poured out a very dark brown with a reddish hue and a small tan head that was the result of an aggressive pour. The small head quickly falls to a coating of bubbles leaving not much in the way lace. HOLY SMOKES, is all that came to mind when I first poured this. The smell of the smoke quickly filled the room leaving not much else the way of smell besides a faint trace of smoked meat I believe was bacon. Following in suit was thee smokiness that dominated the flavor. I started to detect slightly sweet dark fruity malt notes as well as a bit of caramel as this warmed and some of the smoke died down. A bit of a smoky aftertaste lingers around after each sip. This was about lighter medium bodied and hard good carbonation and a smoky coating feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff once the smoke mellowed out, definitely a beer I would have to be in the mood for. Overall an excellent beer that delivers on the rauchbier experience. I would like to try it next time with some smoked meat as the scent and flavor would seen to go perfectly with it.',\n",

I get some chocolate and roasted malt, but the predominant flavor is the smoke. The beer is very meaty smelling. \\t\\tMedium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.\",\n",

Some resiny pine pops up near the end, adding a wet, thick aroma.\\t\\tT: My first impression is big hoppiness. Some grapefruit and lemon rind along with piney resinous flavors emerge early on. They are, however, quickly swallowed by the grainy malt body. The malty body is fairly thin and, thankfully, returns to a very bitter hop finish. That end hops are not very well defined, choosing to overwhelm with bitterness rather than flavor.\\t\\tM: The mouthfeel goes for the bitter effect, starting well but allowing hop entropy to occur.\\t\\tD: The bitter finish is off-putting, ruining a decent hop flavor that appears up front.',\n",

The head is off-white with good blocks of lacing to go with it. The aroma is somewhat non-descript, subtle flowery whaet and touch of hops and apple, kind of a witch hazel suggestion.The taste is a sweet fruit nougat accompanied by a definite alcohol background that mostly comes through as astringent, soapy melon flavor. Not my favorite. Nothing to suggest an IPA here from my experience and not terribly likeable. It's funny looking at the variety of reviews on this beer, I'd have to say that Cooperstown has some issues with consistency. The only thing most of us seem to agree on is that this is not much like an IPA. I can't really recommend this one, especially if you're looking for a good IPA, but it wasn't hideous. But unless this was a bad batch, I can't see anything here to particularly please the tastebuds.\",\n",

The yeast swirling and mixing is quite enticing. There\\'s a small foamy head which quickly settles into a decent lacing.\\t\\tS: The aroma of banana is dominant, as well as a nice smell of cloves. Smells delicious.\\t\\tT: Following the smell, the banana comes through immediately along with the clove and a bit of pepper and tartness, but the tartness is not overbearing. A bit yeasty and bready. Not too sweet. Fantastic.\\t\\tM: Smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. This brew seems just hearty enough to really feel the beer in your mouth, but light enough to stay in that \"Spring Seasonal\" arena.\\t\\tD: Clean and smooth. Highly drinkable, I\\'m just about to have another.\\t\\tNotes: Score one for a local brew! I decided to review this after my second try with the Yazoo Hefe. I had a sixer a couple months ago that was perhaps a little stale; the yeast came out flaky and a little chunky. It was still quite enjoyable, but this batch is flat out delicious. This was bottled within the last month, so be sure to get it fresh.',\n",

But these are all muted by the papery, peppery oak. This also brings sub-bourbon notes of vanilla cream, butter, and hazelnuts. Muted is the key word, as paper/wood/oak and grain booze are the two major aromas, everything else is fleeting, indistinct, and ephemeral.\\tCaramel shows up more in the mouth, along with walnuts, and peanut skins. Oak brings burnt butter, vanilla, and bourbon-esque black cherry. But once again, the flavor profile thins immediately. Oak is more responsible for paper and bland pepperiness. Booze is notable, and seems to suggest sherry, but is equally devoid of gumption. Late black tea and cigarette ash notes.\\tFull bodied, lowly carbonation. So, basically how an Old Ale should be. I wish this was the norm rather than the exception. \\tI feel like I'm drinking this through a flavor-filter. A 9+% oak aged Old Ale, and all I can experience is paper, water-logged butter-caramel, and grain alcohol. It's like that very last, weakest sip of a Beam of the rocks.\",\n",

The combination of all feels fresh and smooth to the mouth when cold, perfect for Aruba\\'s hot climate. I brought a beer back with me to the states to give to a friend who went to Aruba years ago and he shut his eyes and sighed, \"That\\'s the Balashi I missed in Aruba\".

A touch of sweet honey and mango pineapple fruits how does a beer from the midwest get so tropical. Flavor is full of brash hop bitterness alot of hop pellet concentrated IBUs, sweet caramel and sugar coated grapefruit rinds blended together with more herbaceous hop tones like some kind bud, pine cones, and perfume. Caramel juicy malt bill forms but the hop bitterness and flavor really overshadow those malt traces here. Alcohol definitely an evident component in this brew, doesn't seem to thought out just a slew of hops and malt.

I must support the cause with a growler of something, but what? 8 taps available, hmmm, GL Burning River, Pilsner Urquell, Harpoon IPA, Stone Arrogant (cool!), and one with a handwritten label from BBC. Mephi-what? Okay I gotta try it. The lady starts to run a growler and the keg blows! Her best attempts to get someone over with more are for naught. I tell her I'll come back and try again another time and she gets a label, slaps it on the growler and writes N/C on it - No Charge! So I got about ten ounces worth complimentary style and a complimentary growler to boot, yee hah.\\t\\tAppearance - uncaps with a rush of air, but pours with little to no action. There is just a bare ring of bubbles around the rim, and it has a clear golden orange hue.\\t\\tAroma - Belgian-style sweetness and a prominent finishing odor of rubbing alcohol. Geez, how strong *is* this stuff?!?!\\t\\tTaste - I don't know, after that nose, I'm a little intimidated to proceed but here goes...whew...some malty sweetness and banana flavor, and that's about all I get before a tidal wave of alcohol hits. Wow this is strong beer. 10.7%, it feels like beer with a few shots of single malt whiskey thrown in. In fact, the decreased carbonation from a growler filled only 25% full, the heaviness of the style, and the overbearing alcohol give this a very whiskey-like feel. As my mouth adjusts, some grain flavors show through, kind of like the Beelzebub beer, draped heavily with syrupy sweetness. This is potent. A little too raw for my tastes. Though the sweet component comes across genuinely tasty, it always ends with a brash alcohol note. Could this stuff be concentrated somehow and I have the ramped up dregs of a half-keg? I don't know, I will have to try this again when they get a new keg set up or if I ever see a bottle of it.\\t\\tMouthfeel - the feel is wonderful. For a high abv tripel, it feels delicate and smooth. It leaves a coating without feeling thick.\\t\\tDrinkability - I can't see me buying something like this for personal consumption, it's too much like booze and not enough like beer. And yet, in the interest of beer science, I will be fair and try it again when they can fill a whole growler. On that note, I will reserve a harsher score and give this little devil the benefit of the doubt.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Got a 6 pack of this the other day since a nice scotch ale sounded good. Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.\\t\\tA- This brew pours a dark copper color with two fingers worth of off white head that turned into a thing ring that stayed with nice lacing.\\t\\tS- Wow, this brew smells sweet. Lots of sweet dark fruits mixed with equally sweet malts. I can also pick up a good amount of booze. This beer smells very different from other scotch ales I have had.\\t \\tT- This beer tastes similar to the way it smells. Sweet fruits and malts stick out the most, but they are blended with some toffee, caramel, and bitter chocolate that didn't show up in the nose. Tastes sweet but not as sweet as the smell. You can tell this is a stronger beer since the booze is always present.\\t\\tM- Medium bodied with good carbonation.\\t\\tD- Not that high, two would be my limit, too sweet and boozy to drink more then that.\\t\\tOverall I find this beer to be pretty good, I have had this beer many times and enjoy the fact that this beer is widely available in my area. This beer always has a place in my fridge. A great scotch ale from a great brewery.\",\n",

At an incredible 112 IBUs, it\\'s dry-hopped with ten hop varieties.\"\\t\\t Beautiful copper red with good clarity and a very good alabaster head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is dominantly fresh pine, to the extent of being cool and almost minty. Some garlic notes lurk at the background. No alcohol is felt in the smell.\\t\\t Tastes strongly, overwhelmingly, and one dimensionally bitter. Insanely bitter and at the threshold of my comfort level. Whoever thinks that beer cannot get any more bitter than their favorite/most hated D/IPA/Strong Ale/Barleywine needs to try this one. An unsurprising and powerfully bitter finish that doesn\\'t let any sweetness whatsoever be felt. Alcohol is felt in its taste and warming effect. Body is medium and carbonation is on the lower side.\\t\\t This might be the most bitter beer I have ever had (this or Hopsickle), and is certainly not very drinkable. But then, nor is Black Tuesday. I will give it to Founders that it\\'s not a sweet mess like many higher ABV D/IPAs and if it had been lower on the booze coefficient, I will rate the taste higher.\\t\\t However, the complexity of this beer is only on paper. It might be dry hopped with 10 hop varieties and might have a huge malt character, but the only quality that really shines is bitterness. An extreme beer and a punishment on the palate, I am not going to seek it out under normal circumstances. However, this might be one of the very few beers that can provide comfort in an acute case of Lupulin Threshold Shift.\\t\\tAppearance: 4.5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5',\n",

Just a little but they're there. Could'nt really tell it was an Octoberfest at first because of the other flavours covering the base beer.

Apparently in the 1800's it's all the Polish marketing could come up with. Anyway, on with the beer, which I got from a Polish friend and he claims it's good. \\t\\tIt looks pretty good from the pour and that's a start. A pleasing clear and deep golden colour with a head that, while diminishing, does provide some amount of lacing. Initially there isn't much smell.. but as you get deeper into the glass there's plenty of sweet malts to be had. Unfortunately it's not really interesting either.. and that sort of sums up the taste as well. Lots of sweet malts, a little bit of fruity yeast and an inadequate amount of hops to finish it off. \\t\\tThis is not a well balanced beer and the longer it stays in your mouth the more you'll come to realize it. The sweetness grows far too quickly (or perhaps the hops dissipate even further if possible). Either way you're going to need some teeth brushing after this one.\\t\\tMouthfeel is on the watery side with a little bit too much tasteless carbonation on the tip of your tongue. My recommendation here is to pass. The ram on the label that's fondling the beer has clearly had too much to drink.\",\n",

It displays innumerable surface pits and translates a fair amount of stickiness into pebbled hunks and small sheets of lace.\\t\\tI'd love to know what hops Naughty Nellie uses in her perfume. The major component of the nose is unlike anything that I've experienced before and I'm fairly certain that it's hop-related. There's a funky, earthy quality that is somewhat reminiscent of Belgian yeast... yet nothing like it. It isn't an altogether pleasant aroma, but isn't bad either. It's just different. \\t\\tNellie tastes like she smells. I can't decide if hops or yeast is the major contributor to the aroma and the flavor (I'm leaning toward yeast). The brewery mentions apricots in their tasting notes and I would have to agree. While it isn't what I'd call a lip smacking APA, it's beginning to grow on me as I get deeper into the bottle.\\t\\tSweet and bitter are present in roughly equal measure, with sweet fading away on the finish. The body/mouthfeel favors the lighter end of the style spectrum and is well suited to sessioning if the spunky amount of carbonation isn't a deal breaker. This may be the first beer that I've seen that actually calls itself a session beer right on the label.\\t\\tThe Naughty Nellie that Naughty Nellie's Ale was named after was a lady of the evening, harlot, tart... take your pick. Since variety is the spice of life, a maxim that I'm sure applies to her profession as much as it applies to beer, I'm willing to cut her ale some slack for its uniqueness. I won't be buying it again, but for a one night stand, she... er, it... was an enjoyable enough ride.\",\n",

Touch of citrus fruit and sourness. Bitterness is fairly moderate leading to a chocolate like dryness. Carbonation way too high for this style.\\t\\tOverall, pretty disappointed, definitely infected. It almost smelled like a lambic for gods sake. Too bad, this could have been a very promising beer, but the excess carbonation really messes with all the flavors in this beer. I hope Pike is more careful in the future, i definitely won't be buying from them for a while.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Inviting amber color. Monster tan head that will not cease, fitting of a fine brew. Complex aroma consisting of rose petals, pears, peaches, apple blossom, sour cherry. Flavor is a direct translation of the aroma with the addition of a subtle alcohol essence and a slight hop flavor to balance out the complex equation. A very floral bouquet sums up the aroma and flavor experience. Carbonation is spot on, not too high and not too low. Fruity aftertastes linger well after the introductory swallow. A swirl regenerates the tight head and produces a pleasant aroma release. An incredible beer that I would seriously recommend. This outstanding beer paired well with beef, and is one that would surely fare well on it's own.\",\n",

This was aged on oak for I'm not sure how long...but some of those flavors exist here. The overwhelming hop flavor is balanced well between the rye and the oak aging. It is bitter-sweet, and quite a pleasure to drink. Flavors of citrus, vanilla, and plenty of hops here.\\t\\tOverall, a very nice selection. This is a great beer and I'm glad it seems to be doing so well. Nice job Party Town Guys and BBC! Nice.\",\n",

The foam, which is past caramel and halfway to milk chocolate in color, billows up to about four fingers in height. The lacing left around the glass is gorgeous, sheetlike for the most part. Head retention is very good, but just a bit short of perfection. Coffee is the first thing that that jumps out about the nose (which is heavenly), although rich milk chocolate and maple aromas are also present. Everything is so well integrated that it takes a while to pull apart all the different components. The flavor, and I wasn't sure it was possible, is even better. Creamy milk chocolate and a splash of maple syrup swirl together at the front end of each sip. A mild bourbon note that gives a slight warming sensation fills the mid palate, before a strong coffee flavor comes in to close things out. The carbonation is spot on, nice and low. Meanwhile, the body, while being both silky and creamy, could stand to be a bit more full/sturdy. Any qualms I have with Canadian Breakfast Stout are minor, as this is truly one of the top few stouts being brewed in this country. I got up at an obscenely early hour to hunt down bottles of this, and I'd do it all again without hesitation.\",\n",

The idea of taking a Black IPA and adding a sweet element (due to the maple syrup cask aging of it) makes for a GREAT beer for those who might otherwise be highly-afraid of either a pitch-black beer or an IPA (not to mention a pitch-black IPA). I can only hope that Founders will bottle this awesome nectar in the near future, as I feel that it would prove to be very popular; I chalk this beer up as one of my all-time (surprise!) favorites.\",\n",

Thanks for hooking me up with so many hometown brews I haven't had Jesse!\\t\\tPours bright burnt orange with lots of red in it. It looks like maple syrup in terms of color, and has great clarity to go with a short-lived one-finger white head that shows no signs of life. No real bubbling and not even a fizzy nature for how quick it disappeared. Lace somehow forms spottily around the glass.\\t\\tThe smell is incredibly intense, with my nose feeling like it got stuck in a fleshy, sweet mango. Plenty of pine and resin behind the fruit, along with a citrus backbone of grapefruit that is not to be trifled with. Booze in the back seals the deal - I am intimidated to taste this (in a VERY good way).\\t\\tTaste is a gradual hoppy takeover - it starts moderately sweet with plenty of caramel and stickiness, but then you feel your mouth beginning to lose it's stickiness as the bitterness rapidly sucks all the moisture out. Lots of tasty pine and citrus to go with a lesser version of the mango from earlier. The finish is fantastic, as it is very bitter and dry. This may sound unbalanced and unpleasant, but believe me it actually has a great deal of malt character to account for the 168 IBUs that everyone talks about. The finish even does possess a bit of sweetness to prevent the bitterness from becoming a chore to deal with sip after sip. Hops are definitely the star of the show though, and I think everyone knew that going in.\\t\\tMouthfeel is really variable and awesome, as the beer moves from sticky to dry in a very slow and steady manner. You can feel the change as it comes about if you just let the beer sit and swish it a bit in your mouth. Body is full and carbonation is better than the appearance would suggest. Finish might be a bit too intense, but I enjoy it thoroughly. Drinkability one would expect would suffer in a palate wrecker like this, but the balance is to be lauded. I especially love how they got the right amount of pine in the beer, as it stayed enjoyable through the whole bomber. I've had beers with way fewer IBUs that were unbalanced and too bitter; these guys did the big bitter thing right.\",\n",

No freshness date available. \\tI grew up with Costco/Kirkland Signature products, so I couldn't resist trying their new line of beer. Sure enough, it's got Kirkland's signature quality all over it.\\t\\tVisual:\\tGolden amber body, see-through clear. Fizzy tan head that bubbled away like a diet Coke. Slight caps left behind.\\t\\tAroma:\\tVery soft and faint pale malt, with quite the grainy nose. Plenty of lager yeast with a hint of skunk like wet dog hair. Slight hop sourness with herbal notes hiding somewhere beneath the grain.\\t\\tTaste:\\tVery dry bitterness dominates the back of the tongue. A flash of fruit is notable in the beginning, leading to a smooth malty profile. Slight herbal hops in the middle before going back to the dry bitterness in the finish. Medium-light body with a slick mouthfeel; slightly rough carbonation.\\t\\tOverall:\\tA bit sloppy; no real hop or malt structure. And nothing German about this yeast strain. This is more of an American lager than a German pils. I guess they think simply calling it such helps marketing? I may pass on this in the future.\\tIf I were to pair it with food, I'd take a stab at some baked seafood, grilled veggie sandwiches, or some hearty pastas.\\t\\tCheers!\",\n",

The head dissipated quickly so that it looked like I was drinking cola.\\t\\tThis actually smelled like Founders Breakfast Stout, but with less coffee. It was also a little heavier feeling than the Breakfast Stout. A lot of alcohol is apparent in the initial sips, and you can taste the hops bitterness in the after-taste. Very strong flavor, almost too rich.\\t\\tA really good imperial stout, but I probably won't drink it too often.\",\n",

This is more of a brown ale in my opinion, pours with a very small head that dissipates immediately. Color was dark brown, no murkiness. Tastes very coffee like with a strong malt flavor, high carbonation with a pleasant yeasty aftertaste . It's a very tasty beer and I will buy some more if I'm ever down there again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'I sampled Mister E Froot on a visit to Founders on 08/12/2011. I found myself wishing I could buy several bottles are take it home. Among fruit beers, this one has exceptional qualities. However, our friends at Founders are not talking about what those qualities are. The ingredients are a mystery as of right now.\\t\\tThe initial aroma was a powerful berry fruitiness. I would speculate that raspberry and blackberry are among the flavor in the aroma. However, the aroma is also balanced by a woodiness that hints of barrel aging. In the taste, the fruit flavors are balanced by woodiness. Why many fruit beers pound the tongue with just fruit flavors, this is a nice balance. The mouthfeel reminds drinkers that a lot went into this beer. It goes down smooth despite a thicker texture. The aftertaste leaves hints of vanilla which finish the experience nicely. In the overall scope, there are a lot of well balanced flavors to experience in this beer.',\n",

Looks like it will stick around forever. As expected, the beer is pitch black, and as I can already smell it, it looks like the world's best black coffee.\\t\\tThis bottle is super fresh so I expected the coffee to overwhelm, but the quality of the chocolate used in this beer is evident. The coffee aroma is dominant and almost smells like the taste you get from biting into a great fresh, quality bean, but I can definitely smell a quality chocolate behind the coffee.\\t\\tTaste is perfect. It's not overly salty or sweet like some of the ST Blackwater series. The overwhelming taste of a freshly brewed cup of Kona coffee is spot on, followed by a chocolate creaminess on the finish. This bottle is incredibly fresh, so I am still getting a lingering hop bite on the finish, but it's nothing more than a complementary nod to the incredible flavors that came before. \\t\\tMouthfeel is a bit thin for a beer of this style and ABV, but the carbonation level is right on and the finish is very smooth.\\t\\tFBS is a very iconic beer and it's easy to see why. The label brands the beer as a double chocolate coffee oatmeal stout, and that is exactly what it is. In my mind it is an almost perfect example of the coffee/chocolate stout. So glad I got my hands on some very fresh bottles of this.\",\n",

The aroma was sweet, slightly fruity and alcoholic. The taste was, again, malty and sweet, with a notable bitter finish and aftertaste. The alcohol here was apparent in the burn at the end. Overall, it felt smooth. Mostly, it was good, but felt potent, and I couldn't pack in much more than a bottle of this.\",\n",

A little swirling brings the head back fine and brown. I didn't detect much of a nose at first, but after some swirling I detected some burnt toast, candy apples, and licorice.\\t\\tOne taste and you realize that, oatmeal or no oatmeal, this is a genuine Russian Imperial Stout. No question about it. It has that rummy char-like flavor that one finds in no other style of beer. Nice accents of dark toast, figs, licorice, and cola accompany this flavor along with a nice hop kiss. It has a firm, creamy mouthfeel that is divine. I'm not sure what role the oatmeal plays here, but if it's to make the beer smoother and creamier, then it is performing this role admirably.\\t\\tThis is simply an outstanding beer. It has a huge flavor with no booziness or unwanted sweetness. Easily one of the better RISs I've had. It is very reminiscent of Old Rasputin in that it has a lot of character, but is quite a bit smoother, creamier, and better balanced.

The name is spot on as I knew I was in trouble from the first sip. Unlike Hopslam or other Double IPA's that balance the large amount of hops with equal amounts of malt to add a touch of sweetness to cut the bitterness, Founders seems to have left that out with this one. It instantly drys the mouth with a bitter puckering that made me feel like I was in one of the old warhead sour gum commercials.\\t\\tIt smells fantastic! All those hops throwing the classic citrus with pineapple and grapefruit tones all followed up with an almost spruce tree like hint of pine. A golden murky yellow almost honey colored with a rich creamy head, it definitely looks the part.\\t\\tThe first thing you notice when it hits your tongue is unabashed hops. Bitter, citrus and pine, it tastes just as it smells with very little malt to balance the insane amount of hops in this beer. A hop heads dream! Medium bodied but still very substantial mouth feel that lingers nicely after each sip leaving your mouth dry and wanting more. With 86 IBUs it ranks right up that at one of the most bitter IPA's, not in the top 100 but it holds its own.\\t\\tOn Tap at Shark Club of Howell, MI\",\n",

Head retention was impressive; the bubbles were slow to fade to a tight cap. Subsequent lacing was fairly widespread. A small cap lasted the entire consumption. This is a terrific looking beer! \\t\\tUnexpected nose! I smell coffee grinds, burnt toast, old paper, wood, dried earth, and stale (dark) fruit biscuits. The aromas are very well rounded. Caramel notes in the background, maybe some nutmeg fruitcake? Moderate-high potency, chatty I really enjoy the bouquet. It is quite complex without being overly hoppy, malty, or alcoholic. A bouquet like this is very uncommon in the US. I love it! \\t\\tThe palate has a tad more bitterness then the nose explained (which is nice). On the other hand, the maltiness is a bit firmer then expected (which Im indifferent too). There is terrific balance; burnt toast, coffee grinds upfront, tea-like hops, earthy bitterness in the middle, then some dark fruit notes, hints of figs and nutmeg, with a finish that is toasty and vaguely sweet. Dry aftertaste it leaves me wanting more. Complex. Like I said about the nose, a palate like this is very uncommon in the US. Tasty! \\t\\tMedium/medium-light in body, low carbonation, I wish the mouthfeel was a tad fuller and the carbonation was just tickle livelier but these are small complaints. The mouthfeel works well enough. \\t\\tIt takes a beer like this to force me to reflect on all the complaining I do about English beers. Sure, I love Fullers, Meantime, JW Lees, Landlord but so many of the English beers we get in the US are crap like Wychwood and St. Peters. I never heard of this beer until I received it as a Christmas gift from my girlfriends family visiting from England. I was happy to try it. Now that I have, this has been a rambling way to say this beer is freaking awesome and very damn tasty! Id kill to try this on cask. Easy to drink enjoyable!

The head receded fast and did not support a noticeable lacing. \\t\\tS: It had distinct aromas of citrus (lemons), sweet toasted malts, and floral hops. It was reasonably well balanced but none of the flavors established a character for this brew. \\t\\tT: It began with spice tinged creamy and sweet toasated malts and then light floral and bittering hops came into play. The hops were light and added a touch of citrus flavor and very distant white pepper. \\t\\tM: It was light bodied moderate carbonation. I initially finished clean and crsip but as the session carried on there was a slightlyl sour aftertaste that I could not shake. \\t\\tD: It was smooth and fairly well balanced with a light body and low ABV making it a good session brew. However, it's flvors were unimpressive to I doubt I'll seek it out. If it is present I'll enjoy but if not present I'll eaisly move on to one of it's better positioned cousins.\",\n",

Presented to me from the tap in an oversized flute glass the beer was a dark ruby-red color. No head or signs of a head and no lacing throughout the sample. A bit of a dull Juicy Juice color. \\t\\tThe smell was super tart cherries and faint red wine. Some hints of grapes and plums.\\t\\tThe taste was a huge burst of tartness and sourness but kept perfectly in balance with the fruit. So many beers with fruit are overpoweringly sweet and never have anything to balance that sweetness. This beer had an innitial quick burst of fruitty sweetness that was instantly balanced with a tart and sour finish. It made your lips and cheaks pucker and sucked all the moisture out of your mouth and was enjoyable during every step of the way. A dry finish with softer dark fruit flavor and some hints of wine-like alcohol.\\t\\tMedium body and crisp and dry to the finish.\\t\\tVery very drinkable. I enjoyed this one a great deal as I thought it had superb balance and great flavors all around. Certainly nothing to have many of in a sitting as your mouth would feel like a snail that just had salt dumped on it. Perfect with a dessert such as creme brule or perhaps wih eggs at breakfast or brunch.\",\n",

I have had three bottles so far to enjoy, and have a 4th sitting with my vintage beers. \\tServed in a Brandy Snifter\\tA: I don't know really what to say about the appearance. I would have given it a 5 in this category, but there isnt much to see. It pours thick and black, with a head that looks like frothing coffee. The carbonation is pretty hard to see due to the thickness. \\tS: Coffee and a bit of malt. There is a hint of chocolate as well. And when I say coffee, I mean fresh roasted coffee beans. It is a wonderful aroma. \\tT: Heaven in a bottle. Tastes of coffee, malt, roasted hops, chocolate, maybe even a little smokey. Has a hint of oak and bourbon as well. It is very sweet for being so dark and thick. I will never get tired of that flavor. \\tM: Thick. It isnt too bad if you are used to Porters or Stouts. I dont think a Pilsner lover would enjoy as much. \\tD: Excellent drinkability. As soon as I finish one, I wanted another. It is high in alcohol, but you cant really tell. The thickness may be the only thing that could hurt drinkability, but I dont mind that.\\t\\tThis was purchased for $6 a bottle at Binny's in Glen Ellynn, IL (best store in the world). I would have missed it completely if one of the guys I speak with there all the time hadn't pointed it out. The label didnt stick out to me at first. This is one of my favorite beers, and it is hard to get. Binny's is completely out. I hope this isnt the last time I get to enjoy this fine beer.\",\n",

There also some grassy hops and a hint of citrus, but I mostly got soap. The taste starts with little to no malt sweetness or flavor at all. The hop bittness shows up afterward that tends toward sourness at the end. The aftertaste consists of lingering bitterness and possibly a bit of the soapiness that showed up in the smell. The body is very nice, medium range along with medium carbonation. Though a decent APA, this really isn't anything great and could stand to be a bit more balanced.\",\n",

The flavor mimics the aroma with a clean, somewhat sweet maltiness that expresses very little grain character. It's balanced by a low-level bitterness that becomes more apparent in the drying finish where the sweetish malt fades to reveal its underlying bitterness. Not a bad malt liquor - clean and well-balanced with a solid alcohol content! There are many other malt liquors in the lower-alcohol bracket that display their alcohol clearly or show fermentation defects. This one is well brewed.\",\n",

Let's give it a try...\\t\\tPours a cloudy golden mango colour with very little head. Bright white lacing is sporadic; a thin film sits on top of the beer. Smell: grapefruit, sweet malt, nectarines, and piney, cedar-like hops. Taste: juicy crystal and pale malts, white grapefruit, some peach and apricot flavours, and a prolonged hop bitterness. The taste could be a bit 'bolder,' but this is still flavourful. Mouthfeel is on the light side, slightly watery with some tang from the hops. Overall a very drinkable pale, more in the West Coast tradition than other Ontario APA's (Tankhouse, Black Oak, Durham). Trafalgar has done a good job of applying an original concept - unfiltered, wet-hopped pale ale - to fill a void in the Ontario market. Keep brewing beers like this one!\",\n",

Some lacing. \\t\\tBeer smelled of malt and grain with a slightly musty odor as well.\\t\\tTaste was similar to the smell. Lots of husky grain & some subdued malt. Just slight pinpricks of hops. The musty odor was also in the taste, perhaps this was an old sample, but I dont think so.\\t\\tMouthfeel was fine, drinkablity was hindered by the lackluster taste.

Definitely one of the spicier and sweeter pumpkin beers I have had. Hints of raw pumpkin round it out nicely. Good.\\t\\tM: Maybe a touch undercarbonated and just a little syrupy. As stated earlier, there was no head or lacing on this beer, it poured as flat Keira Knightley (wife came up with that one). So there may have been something wrong with the bottle. The flavors are balanced nicely, I dock points simply because it drank slightly flat.\\t\\tO: Frog's Hollow is another solid beer by Hoppin' Frog. Tilts toward the spicy/sweet side of the pumpkin style, but the flavors were balanced and well integrated. Definitely had a prominent cinnamon and brown sugar as well. If it weren't for slightly lackluster carbonation, this would have gotten a better review from me. As it is, it's definitely one of the better pumpkins I have had. I'll definitely revisit, though.\",\n",

The alcohol seems to embed its warmth into the palate, creating an estery/fume-like presence. A bit dry in the finish with apple-y notes, rye husk, and flower pith.\\t\\tThis is one hell of an offering. Amazing flavors and overall character! Love it.',\n",

The two mix well together, creating a lush scent.\\t\\tT: The taste begins with the coffee body, dry and strong with an acidic tart finish. As the coffee fades, the roasted chocolate and toasted malts come through, providing a sweeter, full-bodied element that serves as a nice digestif to the initial coffee flavor.\\t\\tM: The mouthfeel is vibrant and full of flavor, providing coffee bitterness and chocolatey sweetness in one mouthful. I wish that this wasn't my only bottle...\\t\\tD: The 8.3% abv is well hidden, letting the coffee and stout components shine.

It leaves fancy lacing on the glass. It has a strong citrus aroma-- the kind you can smell from across the room. It's fresh and leafy. It has a soft, fluffy, medium body with a dry finish that leaves the tongue feeling a little singed. This is a big, fruity, juicy IPA. It's mostly grapefruit but there are almost hints of pineapple and peach. It gets more bitter as the taste goes on. It goes from fruit to pine resin. It's not really sweet or dry. This is all about delivering maximum hop flavor. The malt takes a back seat, but it's strong enough to support things. It gets a little peppery at the finish. The black pepper flavor lingers with with pine resin for a little while after the swallow. Yeah, this is a bang-up IPA. This is treading into double IPA territory.\",\n",

The bourbon barrels contributed perfectly to the base stout - it's not too overpowering like many bourbon barrel stouts.

Interestingly, when the glass is empty, it smells like... a bag of apricots!?!\\t\\tT- Initial caramel maltiness, with some roasty grains in the back, and an almost burnt-biscuity character that's hard to put my finger on. Hops come in, especially in the back, leaving a lingering grapefruit-bitter flavor on the back of the tongue. \\t\\tM- Velvety with slightly too low of carbonation for my taste and the style.

Bitterness felt throughout entire mouth, possibly one of the most bitter hoppy beers I've ever had. Medium bodied with prickly carbonation felt on tongue.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a US tumbler pint glass.\\t\\tA: The beer is a murky dark gold color, with a thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin on the glass.\\t\\tS: The aroma contains honey, wheat, caramelized malts, and a touch of hops.\\t\\tT: The taste starts out with sweet flavors of honey, bourbon and caramel. Then a hearty malt character comes in along with an alcohol bite that is mild considering the actual ABV. The hops presence is mild but complementary and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.\\t\\tM: Smooth and crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.\\t\\tD: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice, very strong beer worth drinking for as long as you can handle it.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"pike kilt lifter is a scotch ale / wee heavy? this was one of the first beers i had on my trip to the states (the first of many reviews from notes), but the whole time i was thinking it was a scottish ale. \\t\\tthe beer pours out a very nice color, a pretty dark amber. big, creamy head with good retention. i love beers with this look, i can't give this beer anything less than a 4 for appearance as i automatically enjoy a beer more if it looks like this. smells good too. solid scotch ale smells, big caramelly maltiness. the smell really opens up as the beer warms, though it wasn't at first, eventually the little higher abv becomes obvious.\\t\\tbut that 6.6% abv isn't noticeable in the taste. flavorful, malty, very smooth mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable. it's not nearly as big or complex as fat bastard, the wee heavy i am most familiar with. but when i was thinking it was a scottish ale i was happy with it, and i'm not going to change my score. i like both styles, can't really tell much of a difference anyway. i liked it, and it's available at just about every store around the seattle area, so i recommend it and will definitely get it again.\",\n",

I see some nice lacing here.\\t\\tThe smell is super hop dominated with lots of tropical fruits hitting my nosebuds. After a few more whiffs, I do get some caramel malt sweetness but it's on the faint side.\\t\\tThe taste is yummy and hoppy but not, in my mind, overly bitter. Good for that. Lots of grapefruit and mango tickle my palate but I can definitely taste the malt influence of some nice sweet tones...maybe more than others that have reviewed it. Hey, I'm a hop head at times and a malt head at other times so I'm drinking this brew and yes, it has a wonderful bitterness to it but I also like what the malt is doing here and it has a bigger presence to me than what I notice in others' reviews. Come on folks, give the malt some well deserved credit here! ;^) Ok, so no, it isn't anywhere near perfect balance but it has enough malty goodness to take the edge off of what could have been a DIPA that went over the top with the hops and made your mouth pucker with every sip. It didn't do that to me and it *worked* for me. Good show, Founders. I salute you yet again.\\t\\tNice medium mouthfeel with a lowish level of carbonation, it feels very smooth and silky.\\t\\tDrinkability? The big abv is, what can I say but....very well hidden indeed! Dangerously drinkable so I'm glad I can't get this locally or I'd be in &lt;see name of beer&gt;.

The aroma is hard and heavy on malt, along with some spicy dried fruit aromas like raisin and perhaps some piney hops.

Which is good because the beer just misses having that 'cough syrup' flavor that happens when a beer is too sweet and bitter.

       "  'review/text': \"Received in a box from Palmej1, thanks Jacob! From a bomber into my RR pint glass. \\t\\tA- Hard pour yields a two inch head of off white foam. Head recedes gradually. No lacing to speak of. The beer is Dark amber color. \\t\\tS- I have to work to detect much of an aroma. I'm getting sweet bready malt and very faint citrus. \\t\\tT- Malt forward. Buiscuty sweetness, followed by a decidedly orange citrus presence. Slight bitterness enters stage left, but is quickly balanced by the malt bill. Finishes sweet and juicy. \\t\\tM- Carbonation is a bit lacking for a single iPA. This gives the feel a big juicy quality, if that makes sense. Different for the style. \\t\\tD- Not bad. ABV is totally hidden. The beer is refreshing. \\t\\tOverall: Meh. Not a bad beer, just not overly memorable. I can't find a date on the bottle, so I don't know how much age this has on it. Could be I got an old one. Glad I got to try this, but I wouldn't seek it out again.\",\n",

It has a nice mix of wood and maple that compliments a warm wheat malt aroma. The bourbon barrel aroma is pretty intense; very nice. The taste is good. It has a damn tasty wheat and maple flavor with excellent barrel aging. The malt bill is light, meaning it's basically pale wheat malts, bisquit, and Munich malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The drinkability is great! The maple and bourbon hide the alcohol well and make this a very complex and highly drinkable wheat wine.\",\n",

Sweet, balanced, and inviting, but not as complex as could be. Still, great smelling beer.\\t\\tT: Sweet chocolate roasted malts up front, moving seamlessly into a bitter coffee finish. Mildly boozy aftertaste. Tasty enough, but nothing outside of the ordinary for an RIS. Definitely nothing off, though. Solid brew.\\t\\tM: Full-bodied, smooth, with lots of beautifully soft, mouth-filling carbonation. Perfect.\\t\\tD: A little too sweet for me (I'm really not finding the 60 IBUs promised on the label), but the coffee on the finish is just bitter and dry enough to keep things from getting cloying. I'll have no problems finishing the bomber by myself. \\t\\tNotes: Great beer, but doesn't do it for me quite as much as Old Rasputin or FBS. Definitely a great choice for an RIS that emphasizes the sweet chocolatey side of things (far better than Brooklyn BCS, IMO). I'd love to try the barrel aged version someday...\\t\\tCheers!\",\n",

Delicate specks of lace compliment the garnet rings.\\tAroma opens with a profound note of chocolate, followed by earthy oak wood, premium bourbon, and some powerful coffee aromas. The coffee notes are of fresh roasted and unroasted beans like you'd find in a good coffee shop. Very robust! Vanilla and fresh cut sawdust complete the nose.\\tMouthfeel is medium full, the carbonation soft and subdued. Some alcohol burn is present here. The dark roasted malts make their presence known here, with some assertive bitterness.\\tTaste is complex, like the aroma. Chocolate and coffee dominate the flavors. Chocolate is more prominent than expected, but the coffee beans are the real highlight here. Bourbon is easily noted, but is more muted than expected. A bitter, fresh roasted, coffee bean presence comes to dominate as it reaches room temperature. A hint of figs and smoke adds to the complexity. \\tThis one is worthy of its hype, a true masterpiece that is an ultimate sipper.\",\n",

I want to drink this before the head settles.\\t\\tSmell - Smokey roasty malts, sweet chocolaty, and caramelly. I want to drink this immediately!\\t\\tTaste - DARK CHOCOLATE! This is like drinking a candy bar. Not a lot of complexity here, overpowering chocolate with a strong backup of bourbon. can totally taste the 10% ABV, but it's subdued, mellow and not overpowering, probably owing to the bourbon flavoring. A little bit of a smokey finish which is very nice and makes me want to immediately take another swig. I absolutely LOVE dark chocolate, this instantly became one of my favorite beers ever.\\t\\tMouthfeel - A nice heavy, but smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation is just right and the immense flavor is intensified with a little time in the mouth. I love stouts and this is right up there with the best of them.\\t\\tDrinkability - I could drink a 4-pack of these, if the 10% alcohol content didn't knock me unconscious first. This stuff not only tastes great but it packs a wallop. I can see why those who can obtain it not only hoarde it, but are only willing to trade limited quanities. I managed to get four through TWO trades, but I already want more.\\t\\tVerdict - If you like stout, and/or you like dark chocolate, don't waste any time seeking this out. This is an amazing beer, a classic.\\tI would put this above Abyss, and even above Speedway in my tastings. Though Abyss should age the best and Speedway would be enjoyed more by those who prefer coffee to chocolate. I am still awaiting specimens of DL, Darkness and KtG.\",\n",

Thank you Sweemzander for a tasty Imperial Stout!\\t\\tA - Even on the pour, which usually shows color, this beer is blacker than Satan's heart. No light can pass through it anywhere. A vigorous pour released a solid finger of dark brown, creamy head. Thick lacing and a good layer ensued.\\t\\tS - Strong, robust roasted malts with a good helping of cocoa powder dryness and a teeny touch of coffee bean behind a chocolate nose. Add raisins to that. Chocolate covered raisins. No real hop nose at all and definitely robust but not as punch-you-in-the-face as I expected.\\t\\tT - Incredibly modest for how foreboding the pour was. Very robust roasted malts with a light dash of cocoa and born sugar. A molasses-like bitterness hits towards the end but it's so malty the 90 IBU's are no where to be found. Moderately sweet as the roasted malts forcefully push to the front of the palate giving it a dry and lightly bitter finish. No hops to be found and a good, underlying raisin flavor.\\t\\tM - As thick as can be before it literally turns into syrup. The carbonation is fantastic. It's there but not noticeable with how rich and velvety smooth the beer is. A dry and lightly bitter finish comes from the roasted malts. Success!\\t\\tD - The alcohol is definitely starting to creep up on me but isn't all that noticeable in the beer's flavor or aroma. Very well-done and flavorful. Good for the style and nice and warming on this cool, windy day.\",\n",

The foam dissolves quickly to a thin ring around the surface of the beer.

The aroma may best be described as a combination of bourbon and chocolate. Each sip of this full bodied beer is very smooth, silky and slightly chewy. The flavor is much like the aroma. Mainly bourbon and chocolate, but neither dominate. Nice notes of vanilla, oak, and coffee are also present. It finishes dry with an alcohol taste and mild burn. Once gone the chocolate and oak flavor lingers on the palate.\\t\\tThis is definitely an interesting and tasty beer. The flavor is much more balanced than the standard Founders Breakfast Stout, which to me seemed like a pint of cold coffee. The 10% alcohol is hidden pretty well and sneaks up on you before you finish off one bottle. Definitely give this beer a try if you can find it.',\n",

The dried tropical fruit notes are there, but to a considerably lesser extent than in the nose. Strong malt backbone, with a mildly biscuity bent. This doesn't really strike me as an IPA. There's a mild lingering bitterness\\t\\tLight to medium bodied, but on the thin side. Lots of small bubbles on the tongue. Drinkability is just kind of meh. There are plenty of other IPAs I'd rather have, and at the price point I'd not think twice about reaching for something else. This is, however, the first time I've had this in a bottle, and though I took no notes before this isn't as good as I remembered; perhaps it has lost something as a contract brew?\",\n",

No lacing and carbonation is not visible. Overall a nice looking beer. Smell is hard to understand. Maybe I'm\\tjust not well versed in the fruit beer category but it smells like a mixed drink to me. The cherries and maple sweetness are detctable to me. The taste is huge on cherries sugar maple and the oaky maple flavors. Very sweet. Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy and the carbonation is well balanced. Somewhere between a lambic and dry stout. A dessert beer in my opinion but not overwhelming.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Another gift from Johnfurbock in an Oktoberfest trade.... Vielen Dank!\\tPoured from a crockery-style 0.5l stoppered bottle, it produced a rich chestnut colored Bier; a bit cloudy overall, with a verrrry short, tan head which receded at a rapid rate to leave just a thin ring around the rim of fine bubbles. Lacing was nonexistant. I've rarely seen a good head and/or lacing on a Bier with 13% abv or above.... any out there? It has a distinct, sweet caramelly nose, reminding me of an Eisbock type of Bier such as EKU 28 or Samichlaus. Body was a bit more than medium, almost bordering on chewy; feel on the tongue was smooth with exceedingly low levels of carbonation. Flavor gives a lot of sweetness, with caramel and toffee leading the way, and even a hint of chocolate when the Bier warms a smidge. It's very rich, and warming as well, with the 13% abv making itself known quite readily. Found it to be better and better as its temp rose. A nice Bier; a sipper, that's for sure. Thnx again to Johnfurbock! Nice choice, mein Freund!\\t\\tProsit!!\\t\\toverall: 4.15\\tappearance: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4\\t\\t768\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"My stupidity put me on a bus going the wrong way not too long ago. Fortunately for me, I realized there was a Binny's I had never been to. This Binny's, the one on Grand, was not the biggest but they did have the seasonal I've been waiting for for a while now. It lasted less than two weeks in my fridge before I grabbed it and decided to pour it into my brandy snifter.\\t\\tVision\\tStandard characteristics of a pumpkin ale here. Crisp white bubbles that lasted only a few seconds before leaving the barest resemblance of a collar. Burnt-orange to rust colored body reveal a few columns of never-ending carbonation. \\t\\tBouquet\\tThis beer turned me into a time traveler. I swear I was sitting at Thanksgiving 2009 with my eyes close, inhaling deeply the pumpkin pie in front of me. It is identical to every pie that has ever been baked in my presence. That strong pumpkin aroma laced with ginger and cinnamon help stir positive emotions like few beers can. And who can forget the nutmeg. They stand alone as well as together upon every sniff.\\t\\tThe cloves are strong players as well, but they bring up the caboose of this pleasure train. I'm very impressed with this beer. It met my expectations and exceeded them with ease. It is not just spices, it is not just pumpkin. It is the harmonizing of the pumpkin lead singer and spice back-up choir. \\t\\tTaste\\tThe flavors from this beer are outrageous. Subtle while not losing their unique characteristics. The first train car to pass over my lingual muscle is a dessert car. I feel like they took the spirit of pumpkin pie and nailed it. It is that wonderful flavor combination that can not be mistaken for anything else. \\t\\tDissecting it further, it is initially pumpkin and cinnamon twirling in an intricate dance with no fumbles to note. Nutmeg peeks its little head out of the second car as the memory of cinnamon and pumpkin fade to the background. \\t\\tThe last car to pass the station is got to be the cloves. This bitter caress that is seemingly unique. There are sweet notes with it, but it is principally a bitter flavor.\\t\\tOral Sensations\\tI wasn't expecting the body that flowed through my mouth tonight. I want to call it full in texture, but its not quite there yet. It is deceivingly close to being full in nature. It feels smooth, comforting. It is like my favorite pair of pajamas after a long day of dress clothes. \\t\\tIt lingers on my palate, on the roof of my mouth, on my lips, on everything! It is welcome because of the gentle sweetness that constantly perks up. \\t\\tConclusions\\tI'm amazed. Truly amazed. The alcohol only comes out in the slight heat I feel at the back of my neck. It is easy to down, and if I am not careful I find myself sipping this quicker than most beers due to its deliciousness.\\t\\tHoppin' Frog finally hit a home run in my book, and I am definitely going to pick this one up to share with others. To sum it up, smells great, tastes great, looks okay, and drinks well.\",\n",

Tapped into a pint glass from the Wooden handle w/ the \"Wheach PacMan\" on it and enjoyed only one before the Firestone Parabola!\\t\\tAroma- A candied peach aroma upfront and a sweetness that makes you want a taste more than ever! Nothing better. \\t\\tAppearance- Nice hazy, but bright orange body with a 1 finger head that stays for a good minute or two. Minimal lace but still has it. \\t\\tFlavor- Starts with a nice Hefeweizen taste and then breaks into the sweetness. Almost like biting into a peach and then the aftertaste of the peach comes around and stays for a good while.\\t\\tMouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, and decent aftertaste of peach but more wheat in the mouthfeel. Still great!\\t\\tOverall Impression- Perfect summer beer from St. Louis! Very glad O\\'Fallon is up and running again. One of my top 10 favorite beers and has one of the best drinkability\\'s possible. Will be having in bottle and can all summer long and you should be too. \\tCheers!',\n",

While a fine beer, I think it suffered a bit in the company of beers like Backwoods bastard, hand of doom and KBS.\\t\\tThe beer pours a lovely reddish brown amber color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, one gets some sweet malt, vanilla and almost a sherry like quality, what one expects in an aged ale. The flavors on the palate replicate the nost almost exactly, though the beer is just a bit sweeter then I would like to have seen. The beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel, and the alcohol is pretty well disguised. Can't imagine drinking a lot of this stuff, but it wasn't too heavy, boozy or tiring on the palate. \\t\\tA very solid beer, but unfortunately it was in he company of some heavyweights, and I don't think showed its very best.\",\n",

Oily/slippery legs that pull all traces of lacing back into the beer.\\t\\tS: Smells of some dark fruits, but the nose is dominated by charred woody oak, some whiskey, a peaty fragrance, and a hint of vanilla.\\t\\tT: Composed of dark chocolate, some dark fruits, and a whiff of oats. Peat, wood, oak, vanilla and boozy whiskey. At first the barrel characteristics are up front and mostly come through as oak and vanilla with whiskey/bourbon being the least prominent, but as the beer warms whiskey sort of takes over. Fruity, nutty, caramel whiskey. A vague resin/leafy hop presence fights to be noticed in the background. Definitely a beer that might appeal to a bourbon or whiskey drinker. For me, the whiskey presence was too much, and almost tasted like a shot of whiskey was dumped into a bottle of regular BORIS.\\t\\tM: Kind of thin, and slippery. A bit oily as well. On the lower end of high carbonation pretty rich and full bodied, hot in the mouth and going down. Kind of beats up on your palate.\\t\\tD: Too hot and boozy for me.

Pours black with a decent tan head that sticks around as a cap. Excellent lacing that leaves defined and prominent rings down the glass. Smells slightly vinous. I believe that this particular keg has been aged for a year, so I would expect this as well as a bit less chewiness in the mouthfeel. Additional notes of gingerbread and especially, molasses. Warming, with spice and pine notes on the back end. The taste is just awesome. Classic old ale taste with the extra notes of molasses and gingerbread again, but also well integrated boozy and barrel notes as well as a nice, dry bitterness throughout that counterbalances the molasses notes nicely. It is indeed quite smooth, not sticky at all, and with a nice long finish. A fine beer indeed.',\n",

Opened with a Wit-like color, but with less haze and more carbonated. Aromas of light malt / grain blend and a healthy dose of estery spices. Tastes of light malt take precedence over the grains, but contributing residual sweetness that lingered a little too long. Hops balance the malts while contributing backgraound spices and earthiness. Finishes a bit on the sweet / tart side. Body is quite light and refreshing. Low alcohols for flavor make it a real thirst quencer.\",\n",

The carbonation bubbles dawdle slowly upward in perfect lines. The lacing of DD is pleasing to the eye, but nothing spectacular. \\t\\tS: Big. Citrus, tropical fruit, and pine hop aromas blend fairly seamlessly with a ramped up and caramel-ly malt bill. I am impressed by how well the hops match the malts in a 12% beer. This might be the most bitter smelling beer that I have encountered to date. \\t\\tT: The tropical fruit hop and malt combination is the initial flavor blast onto my palate. The caramel malt presence then sits sweetly and heavily on the broadside of my tongue, which is sucked away at the end of the sip by a puckering, resin-like bitter hop attack. The high a.b.v. is evident as the beer warms. \\t\\tM: Very full and sweet for the first half of the sip, then a combination of heavy hops and alcohol dry the mouth and clean the sweetness of the malts off of my palate. \\t\\tD: This is about as drinkable as a 12% \"Triple IPA\" can come. The alcohol is very evident in the smell and taste as the beer warms, but the balance between hops and malts is struck phenomenally well.',\n",

Very excited to try this beer!\\t\\tA: Bottle poured into my new Great Divide Brussels glass. Jet black with a very dark brown head, close to Marshal Zhukov's in head color. Very dark and thin head that settled to a brown ring atop this black beast.\\t\\tS: Barely have to put my nose into this one to smell it. Without even attempting to smell I picked up a gigantic dark coffee and rich roasty malts. Putting the nose to the beer only accentuates the previous aromas. Fresh ground coffee, vanilla, some sweet bourbon. Huge semisweet chocolate aroma, and a bit of burnt wood. Only picking up a bit of alcohol, can only imagine how this will mellow out with age.\\t\\tT: A near perfect balance of sweetness and roasted malts. Great alcohol presence. The bourbon comes through very nicely and is mellowed by the vanilla bean on the palate. Never had a beer that tasted like a spoonful of fresh ground, dark roast coffee beans. Picks up all the woody qualities of the oak barrels, along with the sweetness. Has an aftertaste of bourbon whiskey. Very complex flavors here. Slight maple syrup flavor on the end.\\t\\tM: Incredibly rich and full bodied with no one element outweighing the other. Thick and syrupy like a barleywine, roasty and dry like an RIS. Excellent heat from the alcohol that doesn't overpower the beer. Flavor lingers for quite a while after each sip.\\t\\tD: Easy does it with this one, slow and steady. This beer offers so many levels of flavor each and every sip that it needs to be enjoyed slowly. Appreciate its complexities with a good book or just as a great night cap! I am also tempted to try one of these in the morning instead of my morning cup... Great beer all around.\",\n",

The current release is a DIPA, which frankly is the only cauldron I'm familiar with (it was an IPA/DIPA the last time I ordered a cauldron at the horsebrass several years back). In any event... at the Horse Brass yesterday.\\t\\tThe beer pours an orange copper color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is all hoppy IPA goodness, showcasing a huge aroma of dry citrus, pine and sandlewood. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this West Coast all the way DIPA. This DIPA is not for the faint of heart and is a bit much even for a hophead like myslf. The finish is quite dry and hoppy, and there's barely enough sweet malt to balance and hold up the avalanche of hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is actually fairly light, with a long, persistentely bitter finish. Drinkability is good, with the alcohol barely noticeable in this well crafted beer. Still, this beer is so hugely hoppy/bitter, it's really hard for me to imagine ordering more than a single glass. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from the folks at Caldera.\",\n",

They serve em a bit too cold here, but I havent yet acclimated to the dry eastside climate so Ill make do with a bit of cold for now. \\t\\tCrystal Bitter is billed as a hybrid of British, American, and German styles. It is cold filtered and lagered, resulting in a beer that boasts a lively kick of bitterness and refined clarity. The body is ruddy-bronze with a velvet head and low carbonation. The super abundance of hops leaves fine lace on the glass and a faint hop aroma. A slight malty flourish protrudes but the flavor is primarily defined by a zesty sting of bitterness that damn near reaches out and slaps you in the face. The lagering process has kept the beer clean enough to allow a bracing surge of bittering hops that still drinks well. Crystal otherwise approaches the threshold of being overly bittered, especially for an ESB.',\n",

The nose was citrusy hops with a slight caramel sensation and some distant, light fruit. The taste was very hoppy and very dry.

Served up in a tulip. Get on it.\\t\\tA: Looks just like the regular BORIS. It has that shiny, inky black body that has some gloss to it. Its dark and not letting any light through whatsoever. Moving it around in the glass, you get that light yellow film being left on the glass. The beer appears to be thick and creamy. But yet again, there is pretty much zero head. There was a little bit of brown bubbles that came up, but they were minimal and disappeared quickly. No lace whatsoever. Has that somewhat boring look that the original had. \\t\\tS: This shines here in the nose. First things first. The whiskey and wood really come out. This is nice and boozy with a good amount of vanilla wood notes. The best part is that it doesn't cover up the original BORIS aroma. Getting all of that hearty, earthy oatmeal that is nice and lightly sweet. Behind that you get the bitter chocolate presence, that is semi sweet and nicely bitter. This is great.\\t\\tT: Hmmm. I will start off by saying this is good . . . probably a little better than good. BUT . . . the booze really overpowers this beer. The flavor profile is almost all boozy whiskey notes and vanilla. It kinda feels like a completely different beer without the BORIS base. I mean I am not getting any of the Oatmeal really at all that I got in the original. That was the best part for me. I am getting some chocolate notes along with some dark fruit (maybe plum, cherries and fig). With all that said, I still really like it but its a bit disappointing in some flavor arenas. \\t\\tM: Coming across big and creamy like the OG BORIS. Has that nice weight to it that coats just enough, allowing flavors to linger and let you fully understand them. Getting a little more heat on the palate and throat than I remember from the original, but that may be my imagination stemming from the booze flavors. Aftertaste is all woody vanilla notes and booze.\\t\\tD: This was interesting. Its really good but I feel a little let down. The best thing for me about the original BORIS was that huge oatmeal presence and this really doesn't have that at all in the flavor. The booze and whiskey notes really took over and completely changed the beer. Original BORIS became a standard for me, and I feel if you are going to screw with something, you need to make it better. And I truly can't tell you if it has become better and I fear it hasn't. Its good. Its quality, but it isn't blowing me away or making feel it improved BORIS. Ah well. Its still good and drinking well. \\t\\tServing Type: 22oz Bottle Vessel Type: Tulip Price:NA\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Founders Breakfast Stout (aged around 7 months)\\t\\tPoured into slender tulip. Generated a quarter inch medium brown head, which was short lived. Thinned down to a small ring. Body is intensely dark and thick, almost pitch black, with dark brown opaque highlights. \\t\\tAroma is big, big roasted espresso, intensely roasty and almost acrid. Some faint cooked oats, and some bitter chocolate lingers in the back. Great aroma, even though the ABV isn't that high, the nose is quite intense. \\t\\tTaste is a huge roasted espresso hit, some bakers chocolate, and some hop bitter. So creamy smooth and super chewy, the oats add immense body to this beer. Some floral hop in there as well, which is nice to see even with the aging. The finish is super long, with lots of coffee and baker's cocoa in there, and some faint cooked oat. Taste is slightly burnt around the edges, but not in a bad way. Taste is a bit malty sweet toward the center as it warms.\\t\\tMouthfeel is super chunky and chewy, like a chocolate-oatmeal snack bar. A nice carbonation cuts through about midway and brings forth more of the roasted flavor. \\t\\tThis is the kind of beer that I could (and would, if it were more available). Drinkability is superb, and this beer has it's ABV so well hidden that you don't realize how quickly it starts to fuzz the memory. This beer deserves all the hype it receives.\",\n",

Very little head, even on pour. The best I can say is that the foam looked like a spiderweb stretched across the top of the beer.\\t\\tS: The nose is syrupy sweet. Maple and bourbon, more of an emphasis on the maple, are nearly divine. The heftier wheat lends a mild tartness that transforms into booze.\\t\\tT: First, my only complaint with this beer. The booziness is intense, almost too much to take. Luckily there is an abundance of activity before the booze takes over. Thick maple syrup, sugary sweet, shares the stage with bourbon. Vanilla, brown sugar, coconut all appear prominently (behind the maple, that is). Wheat is thick. as you'd expect for a wheatwine. Carbonation is a nonfactor, although it isn't missed. Alright, I lied. My second complaint is that the booze takes over the finish when I'd much prefer maple bourbon.\\t\\tM: The mouthfeel is great at first. The maple and bourbon, sweet and smooth, is incredible. Unfortunately, the boozy wheat finish is not nearly as good.\\t\\tD: I'm content to drink more for the sheer deliciousness of the maple bourbon convergence.\",\n",

No mention of the BBC except for small print at the side of the label and the usual BBC bottle cap. Is 8%ABV a double IPA? Seems like the high side of a plain ol' IPA to me but that may be picking nits.\\t\\tSlightly hazy copper with an offwhite head. Pretty good retention with a little left behind on the glass. Big Amarillo hop aroma over some sugary, bready malt. Amarillo always has a striking resmeblance to some sort of fruit pee to me. Not my favorite, but it is done well here.\\t\\tSugar and pears roll across the tongue with a solid hop bitterness chasing. The bitterness wins in the finish and hangs out to hop up and down for a while in a haze of alcohol. Hop flavor is not as pronounced as the aroma but it is definitely present throughout, just hanging out for the ride.\\t\\tMedium light body with just a tad under a medium carbonation provides a nice smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability would be very high if it weren't for the sticking heavy bitter. Not a bad thing in a big IPA.\\t\\tVery well brewed, worth seeking out unless you don't like the choice of hop. I think I paid $6.99 for the six. A steal compared to the better known brands and quality is as good as, if not better than, the better American IPAs out there..\",\n",

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer pours and looks like motor oil and has a slim brown-creme colored head. Smell is pretty enjoyable, coffee and chocolate malt being the most prominent. There is quite a bit of coffee in the taste, in fact, mostly coffee. Starts out slightly sweet, but quickly transitions into a strong coffee taste with a slight chocolate lingering and a dry, bitter, coffee finish. A little too much coffee for me. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, chewy and with little carbonation. This beer is reasonably drinkable and in fact, the more I drink it, the less the coffee taste is bothering me. I'm going to bump the taste up to a 4.0. If you like coffee and beer, you'd love Founders Breakfast Stout!\",\n",

The smoke is not overpowering and comes through more in the smell than the taste.\\t\\tMouthfeel - The unexpected again. Surprisingly, light on the tongue for a beer with not much carbonation.\\t\\tDrinkability - Much greater than expected. This beer excels because it does not beat you over the head with its smoke. The smoke is a strong highlight but not necessarily the only thing going on with this beer. Despite its relatively-low 5.4% APV it is not an easily drinkable beer on its own. This beer calls out to be paired with food and I felt it would be difficult to get through an entire beer without food to cut some of the smoke and act as a counterpoint. That being said it is magnificently drinkable beer with food.\\t\\tPairings - I don't see this beer working with smoked foods. I see this beer shining when paired with hearty food that would provide a contrast to the beechwood smoke. Try - mac 'n' cheese; beef stew; grilled steak; Cobb Salad; pasta carbonara. A sharp cheddar is the perfect accompaniment. \\t\\tI expected a 2 x 4 of smoke to the head but what this beer gave me was more subtle, clean and light than expected. Sometimes less is more.\",\n",

Buttery, nutty malt sweetness from the combination of Munich and medium caramel malt dominates the aroma, w/ herbal Hallertauer providing contrast.  Light hint of fruity melanoidins add complexity.  A snap of bright, ripe raspberry like fruitiness quickly widens into a malt profile comprised of lightly toasty Munich, and a clean, pleasant caramel sweetness.  Herbal, slightly earthy hop flavor and mild hop bitterness dart into the flavor profile as the initial malty sweetness fades.  Perhaps a touch lacking in body, but dextrinous enough to help facilitate excellent drinkability.  Finishes lightly sweet and grainy, but otherwise clean. Although Stoudts Fest falls a touch short in malt character and body, but is nonetheless a well crafted, tasty and highly quaffable brew.',\n",

Poured from a brown 64oz Black Forest growler into a pint glass.\\t\\tA- This beer pours a dark amber red color with one and a half fingers worth of off white head that died down to a really thing ring after a couple minutes. It left a little lacing but not much.\\t\\tS- The aroma is full of caramel malts with a good amount of floral hops at the end.\\t\\tT- The taste is pretty similar to the aroma. The caramel malts dominate this brew, they are sweet, but not too sweet. There's good amount of floral and citrus hops in this red that make it a little hoppy for its style, but it's not overly bitter, it helps balance all the sweetness from the malts.\\t\\tM- Medium bodied with medium carbonation.\\t\\tD- This brew is quite drinkable. It is balanced well and doesn't have any off flavors. This beer goes down quite smooth and has enough flavor to keep me interested. I split most of this growler with my brother but a full one to myself wouldn't be a problem.\\t\\tOverall I thought this was a pretty nice red. It was on par for its style and had a great balance of caramel malts and floral hops. This is my go to beer at black forest when I want a sessionable beer. This brew could hold its own against most reds on the market.\",\n",

The smell is smoke, burnt caramel, pepper, and hops. And smoke. And more smoke. It tastes of warm scotch, caramel, a touch of mint, and a smoky but not overpoweringly so finish. Plus more smoke. The mouthfeel is slick & very smooth but just a bit watery. Very little carbonation. It is drinkable beer, with a good balance of sweetness & smoke. After a while, the smoke builds up & its just too much for me. Rauchbiers are interesting but they are for someone else. If you like them, go to Bamberg. You won't be dissappointed.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'A: The appearance is dark to medium brown with hints of red shining through the glass. It\\'s like a very dark rosewood color. There is very little head, and it\\'s an eggshell white color. The color lends itself to most of the rating, and the lack of head detracts from it.\\t\\tS: It literally smells like I walked into a bakery or a Christmas shop. At first I\\'m really surprised, because it smells like apple turnovers. It really does, you have to smell it to believe it. I get a cinnamon scent as well as other spices, but I can\\'t readily pick them out. I smell what might be ginger. This has a very fruity character to it. This is fantastic. This is what I want every Christmas Ale to smell like.\\t\\tT: I don\\'t get that apple flavor, which is probably a good thing. I get more of a banana flavor out of the actual body of the beer...take it or leave it. There\\'s the cinnamon, right there in my face. The beer is actually quite subdued in regards to flavor. I expected it to be a bit bolder, when categorized as a warmer (in regards to malt flavor). This is by no means, a bad thing, it\\'s just not what I expected.\\t\\tM: It has a very decent mouthfeel. It\\'s medium bodied and wet. It coats well, but I feel it is a tad undercarbonated. Overall it does feel average though, so I\\'m rating it as such.\\t\\tO: Overall this is a very neat beer to have on hand during the holidays. I\\'ve had quite a few different \"holiday beers\" that don\\'t deliver the experience that people are looking for. For this alone, the beer deserves accolades. This IS the beer that you give somebody who is looking for a holiday beer, and it\\'s one of those \"best kept secrets\".\\t\\tLast year I had this beer and it tasted different. There was more cinnamon and it didn\\'t smell like apples. I prefer the smell of this years beer, and the taste of last years beer.',\n",

Looks dark brown, almost black, and appears very dark ruby red through the light. \\t\\tS - The smell is hops and barleywine, with the hops fading and the barleywine become more pronounced as it warms. In fact, it almost smells like a hoppy imperial red ale. \\t\\tT - To me, the taste is very complex and great. The 100 IBU's is very well hidden, and the hops blend in nicely with the rest of the beer. I taste hops, figs, dark fruits, and dark chocolate in the back taste. Man, this beer is delicious. I would best describe it as a hoppy barleywine/imperial red/porter mix\\t\\tM - Has a thick syrupy mouthfeel.\\t\\tD - This is a sipper, but VERY drinkable for a 12% barleywine. As opposed to other BA reviews, I actually think it hides the ABV very well. \\t\\tI really enjoyed this beer, and wish I could have grabbed more than one. If this was a yearly release, and cheaper than the $6/bottle I paid, this would always be in my fridge.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Appearance: It pours a hazy, caramel/amber color. The haze is partially attributable to quite a bit of sediment swimming about. The head is light caramel in color and is only about a finger deep. Retention was somewhat average and a light, sticky coat of lace clung to the glass.\\t\\tSmell: No doubt this one's chock full of hops. They're pretty aggressive and easily are the standout. They're mostly piney and citric. Plenty of citrus grapefruit, orange, and pineapple to go around. Malts are pretty prevelant. Ultimately, it has a sweet smell. But, the hops don't seem to be deterred by the malts. They shine throughout in this department. No alcohol is noted.\\t\\tTaste: An intense hop bitter really attacks the palate on the first sip and doesn't relent. It's incredibly piney, bitter, and resiny. The citric quality of the hops is definitely worth noting. There's loads of citrus grapefruit, pineapple, and orange flavor. Despite the strong hop attack, there really is a prevelant malty aspect to this beer. It's sweet, but really doesn't do much to curtail the hop assault. That's the most interesting aspect of this beer. Another fine compliment...alcohol is not noticeable at all. It finishes dry and very bitter. \\t\\tMouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied, but barely. The mouthfeel feels just a tad thin. The carbonation seems to be low, which helps. But, honestly, it's difficult to tell with the hops working as hard as they are. Drinkability is pretty high (for me). I'm really enjoying this one. It's damn bitter...just the way I like it.\\t\\tHoppin' Frog did an excellent job with Mean Manalishi. Personally, I really like the aggressive character of this beer...or should I say aggressive hops? Frankly, they're one and the same. If you're a hophead, find a bottle. You won't regret it.\",\n",

One of the best smelling beers I have ever sniffed. clean, nothing offensive, the smell begs it to be drank.\\t\\tT- This is a very malt heavy IPA, but it must be kept in mind that after year of aging, the hops have decreased a bit. This was still a bitter beer and had a good piney hop flavor, but the malt and alcohol became much more prominent. The after taste was harsh alcohol and it lingered. Somewhat unpleasant, but didn't detract from the overall taste.\\t\\tM- Thick and malty. Warm alcohol.\\t\\tO- Such a fantastic beer. I had it fresh as well when it was first released and remember it being awesome. I'm sure it is a totally different beer after the aging. Either way, seek it out, drink a few fresh, and hold on to a few. Founder's just doesn't do bad beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '12 oz bottle, purchased from a reputable bottle shop, bottle marked 6/17/11 (bottled on).\\t\\tPoured into a Corsendunk Tulip\\t\\tPours a nice one finger head which, which slowly reduces to a thin cap.\\tVery deep amber color. Impressive ale color. Fine (very small) carbonation bubbles.\\t\\tGood piney hops and malt smell when first opened but then they fade to not all that distinct. The malt takes over the aroma rather quickly, even though you still get that piney, bitter smell from the hops. This can be repeated by swirling the glass and reviving the head, but then it quickly fades again.\\t\\tMouth drying, aggressively hopped, entry on the palate, followed by rich malt, lots of bitterness. Very full mouth feel with a medium sweetness and fine carbonation.\\t\\tLong bitter finish.\\t\\tOverall this was a very unusual experience. Not sure what to think about this ale. \\tIt is very full bodied and aggressively flavored, but what are the flavors and smells? Nothing really comes forward to be identified in a meaningful way. I know I am being vague here but then that is the perception this ale gives, one of vagueness. \\t\\tAfter the first brief hit of aroma the hops are neither piney nor citrusy, just bitter smelling. The malt is present but rather overpowered by the bitterness. In no way could it be stated that this is a balanced ale and you can detect the ABV, which for me and my big brew tastes is highly unusual. \\t\\tBecause of the brewery and the other ales I have had (all excellent) I had tried hard to purchase an entire case of this, but was only able to buy two bottles. Lucky for me, as it turned out, considering the cost, and over the top nature of this brew. \\t\\tConsidering the 12% ABV and the 112 IBUs I do not believe that this ale was too old. I also know the owner of the bottle shop and he is very aware of how to store and care for beer.',\n",

Balance is fine, aftertaste is a little syrupy and sweet from the \"glucose syrup\" added to boost the abv, although the hops seem to do a decent job balancing out what is borderline cloying. \\t\\tD-Nothing to brag about, but better than most Euro strong lagers. The malt is of higher quality, which many other brands seem to skimp on. This product is mildly overpriced, probably due to its import status and availability (purchased at LeClerc in France).',\n",

I wish they were constantly available because I love them so much, but I also feel that the limited availability makes me appreciate the brew all the more. Devil dancer is a one of a kind beer and it has a unique and complex flavor that allows it to stand apart from any other IPAs. \\t\\tAppearance - Whether it be from bottle or on tap, Devil Dancer pours a beautiful dark amber. It has head comparable to most high alcohol beers, and lacing is prevalent while the head remains, but quickly dissipates mid way through the session. \\t\\tSmell - Sweet aromas emanate, while a sharp twinge of hops comes off the back. The typical IPA aromatics are there, but are followed by a complex sweetness, especially as it begins to warm.\\t\\tTaste - Similar to the complex aromatics, Devil Dancer has a strong presence of hops on the front, but not overpoweringly so along with the typical citrus and pine flavors from a quality IPA. Sweet caramel and brown sugar notes quickly follow along with a slow bitter bite as the after taste. Most would expect some overpowering characteristics from a Triple IPA, but in the case of Devil Dancer, the full taste of a triple IPA are present, but it drinks much more like a double IPA. It is also not overpowered by the rather high alcohol content, and actually provides a nice balance between the flavors and presence of alcohol.\\t\\tMouthfeel - Rich and creamy beer with a smooth consistency and a full body.\\t\\tOverall - Devil Dancer is a beer that is fantastic whether it be on tap, or found in a much sought after four pack. It has a great taste that any true IPA drinker will enjoy, and though it has a high alcohol content (12%-13% depending) it is not an overpowering characteristic of the beer as many would think. Highly recommended, and its a great beer for any beer lover to try.\",\n",

Everything seems disjointed somehow.\\t\\tM: Light and silky with lower-than-average carbonation. Sediment was noticeable at times and was rather unpleasant.\\t\\tD: Goes down alright and finishes clean with a tart and lemony aftertaste.\\t\\tI was pretty disappointed with this one. Some of the flavors were pretty good and it smelled alright, but perhaps the beer just needed more time for the components to blend. I bought this in a mixed sixer, so it's quite possible that I just got and old and/or bad bottle. It may be worth my while to try and find a fresh one and give a second opinion, but for now, first impressions are not good.\",\n",

Flavors are not all that complex, but work together in perfect harmony: slightly sweet malt, grassy hops, and a clean (somewhat drying) bitterness. Fantastic drinkability too. Beware of the green bottles, as older ones tend to get a little light struck and cause some skunky flavor notes. I\\'d love to try this stuff on tap one day.

Pretty good off-white head diminishes rapidly to a thin ring that leaves a little bit of lace.\\t\\tSmells are not over-abundant, but they're good when I concentrate on inhaling them out of the glass. Nutty, grainy malts and maybe just a bit of chocolate and possibly some dark fruit? I wish the aromas had more intensity, they're enticing, but too scant.\\t\\tFlavors are a similar story--for the quality they seem to lack some oomph. Solid malty nuttiness, just a bit of sweetness that balanced out by ample bittering for a mainstream amber. Along with bittering hops, I notice just a bit of earth in the hops as well. I'm still intrigued by a bit of yeast flavors going on that somehow isn't surprising, having heard some about Gordon Biersch's head brewer being trained as a brewer in Germany. (hopefully that's true and I'm not mixing up my Southern California breweries)\\t\\tMedium body and a fairly long finish round out the beer pretty well. Carbonation seems adequate.\\t\\tThis beer seems like it can't make up its mind from being an easy-drinking unmemorable gateway beer to a really quality Amber that stands out from a crowded pack. If the aroma and flavors stayed the same but upped the intensity, it would be up there with some of the best ambers I've had. However, making the flavors a little more mainstream, knocking back the bitterness and ABV some seems like it would fit better with the idea of an inexpensive case of session craft beer. Either way, it's worth a try in my opinion. If the other styles pan out, I'll be getting the case again for sure.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Just got home after close to 12 hours behind the desk ... ugghhh.. Had a PBR that SAS left in the fridge.. Now I\\'m boxing up some beer and want just one more.. after a stroll around the cellar, I saw a small stash of the Nemesis and remembered that I\\'ve never reviewed this one. Thanks to everyone who sent me these, but this one came from Izecold88... Thanks Manny for a great trade!!\\t\\tNot much of \"POP\" when opened... but there was definitely some carbonation... poured a bit aggressively into my small stemmed glass.. 2 finger lite tan head drops leaving pretty nice crusty lacing.. the brew is crystal clear lite orange/lite amber .. \\t\\tNose is still pretty hot.. essence of both honey and bourbon show nicely.. wood hangs around in the nostrils for a bit.. bits of fruit remind me of cotton candy... I never cared for cotton candy .... lots of vanilla.. \\t\\tBig and boozy.. yet sorta thin on the palate.. the alcohol sorta strips away alot of the nuances.. I get plenty of oak and some maple syrup essence that is walloped by the EtOH.. I get some unidentifiable spicy phenols.. and weird hints of banana in the mix... sweet yet tannic on the finish.. I just don\\'t get it.. this is at least the 4-5th time I\\'ve had this and the few previous notes say about the same thing.. that this is a beer with no direction and too damn hot from front to back... Trainwreck.\\t\\tBody is somehow both thick and thin.. sugary and teeth coating and the booze just burns things out.. not enough carbonation either... \\t\\t3.5/3.5/3/3.5/3 .. and I honestly feel I am being very generous.\\t\\tI will not open another of these bottles for at least a year... probably two... that said, I want a few more just to see how they develop... \\t\\tThanks again to Manny.. I truly appreciate the great trade.',\n",

Tons of grapefruit and wet hops. My nose is catching a fair amount of simco, but there's wetness that produces a white grape like scent with some acidity.\\t\\tT. Incredibly sharp hop kick immediately after splashing the palate that bites the tongue. Tons of carbonation, and a champagne like taste to follow the hop kick.

       "  'review/text': \"Pours a slightly burnished gold with strong, steady bead and a modest, but decent white head with large bubbles on the top. It retains very well and leaves spots of sticky lace as it sinks. It's a wonderful-looking lager, everything efficient and proportionate.\\t\\tNose is kind of sweet 'n' sour, a lot of malt with a caramel edge, almost toffee-esque, with a rich chocolatey whisper on it as well, just a slightly more earthy malt character. Hops are herbal, with coriander and basil notes, not very spicy and actually a bit simple, doesn't quite balance out the malt. Very pleasant smell, though would expect more from the hops.\\t\\tTaste is predominantly sweet, with a long and detailed malt profile. Slight tang on the front, like soda, descends into a caramel buttery palate, smooth, gentle sweetness with a little bit of bread dough on the middly, though not enough to be sickly. Phenolic, slightly astringent hops strike late in the piece, after the flavours of the malt have calmed down and thinned out. Again, I expected them to be more dominant, but having said that, they do their job in cleaning up the stickiness, albeit late.\\t\\tMouthfeel is decent, fairly full body and a bit of texture from the bubbles, not quite all there in either sense though, just fall short leaving this a bit bland on the feel. A clean, effective lager with some nice flavours. Good, but not great, pilsener character, even from the grand-daddy of them all.\",\n",

Great lacing.\\t\\tS - Sweet malt in the nose. Further examination reveals oak and bourbon. Slight touches of alcohol. A bit buttery.\\t\\tT - The fist taste is sweet malt. It is quickly high-jacked by the oak flavor. There is a slight taste of bourbon, but as you sip it more, the bourbon becomes more pronounced. The aftertaste is dry and slightly bitter. Other than the drying effect, the alcohol seems hidden.\\t\\tM - Sticky and syrupy, coats the tongue well. The carbonation is pretty low, would have liked a bit more. Very dry finish.\\t\\tD - A very nice beer. With so many stouts being aged in bourbon, it was nice to have a Scotch Ale. The style really lends itself to the bourbon. The ABV of this beers knocks it out of \"session\" territory, but I could drink maybe two of these in a night. It is a great sipper.',\n",

There's minimal teardrop lacing dotting the inside of the glass. \\t\\tThe aroma brings a thick cloud of malt, buzzing with a tart-edged honey sweetness. A light toffee note is offset by a muted metallic bitterness of indistinct hops. \\t\\tUpon sipping, there's a dense tid of malt, swirling and tilting amid the distinct caramel-like sweetness of cooked honey. A rounded baked dough presence swells gently in the middle. The hops play through toward the end with a very mild fragrance, then linger at the finish with a subdued bitter glow. the flavor has an interesting profile, but it would benefit being minus the honey's assertion. \\t\\tMedium bodied, the muscular malt character makes it feel chewy on the palate. The various elements combine to leave a warm tingle at the finish. \\t\\tThe malt stands tall, flexing and posing, but the honey plays the role of a pesky foil. That's a shame, really, because with just the malt and hops you'd have a very present, if not overly impressive, balance. While the sweetness doesn't necessarily cloy, it does detract fromt he stronger, more desireable elements. I'll finish the sixer, but it may take a while, because it's drinkable only in small doses.

The head retention is surprisingly good for being such a strong beer. The aroma showcases a bigtime maltiness with notes of burnt sugar, caramel flan & treacle pudding. The hops have become very subdued, but combined with the spiciness from the yeast offer herbal complexity interlaced with a tinge of fruitiness (dried orange, grape seed, oroblanco) that barely manages to escape the huge sweet toasted maltiness. The flavor is multifaceted with burnt caramel & honey sweetness upfront followed by a firm toastiness (graham crackers, gingerbread snaps) with a hint of chocolate. The hop bitterness has subdued and offers just enough to provide a smooth, balanced finish. This baby's strength becomes more evident towards the finish, but never detracts. Awesome stuff! I'd have to report that this Belgian-inspired barleywine has held up remarkably well over the seasons and is certainly a testament to the American craft brewer's spirit.

       "  'review/text': \"Appearance - pours a reddish copper with a thin head of white. Moments later, the cover is bare save for an uneven ring. Somehow manages to place a few bits of lacing here and there. Turns pretty cloudy/chunky with the last few ounces added.\\t\\tAroma - sweet with a base, indistinct fruitiness. Hints of yeast at times and a full vapory alcohol effect on a deep inhale. Smells pleasant enough if somewhat plain.\\t\\tTaste - before the grains can make any impact, a rush of sweetness and alcohol move in and set up. A bubble gum or maybe Pez candy flavor, a big alcohol effect which ducks any harshness. The swallow begins a trail of warmth from the back of the throat all the way down to the stomach, like the tail of a comet. I'm no expert on the style, but as far as I know this tastes pretty good and would probably also do well if aged a while. The aftertaste is more like an after-thought, mostly just shadows of the candy flavor and the abv.\\t\\tMouthfeel - an element of heaviness, syrupiness that helps without overdoing. Bubbles are lively, well done.\\t\\tDrinkability - I'm glad I bought these at the Founder's Brewing Company event sponsored by the Dilly Deli, but this isn't something I'd keep around.\",\n",

A close sniff seems to suggest the presence of staleness. Balanced, quietly enjoyable.\\tT: pleasantly sour, sweet coffee-ish and dark malty in taste, the swallow is backed by lingering undertones of black dates, burned nuts, brown malts, and finished with a bit of chewy and earthy hop bitterness. The dark malts and bitter hops balance each other quite well, rendering a simultaneously lightly chewy, bitter roasty and aromatically malty finishing palate.\\tM&D: the carbonation remains decently refreshing and never over the top, while the medium body supports the moderate flavour profile just fine.

I recall that they use ringwood years here, so this is not a big surprise. The flavor is a little better. There is a solid roasted character that moves to a more mild sweet caramel and finishes with a mild earthy hop and bitter. This is much better than the aroma. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I am really not able to move past the aroma on this one. It just rubs me wrong to have that much diacetly.

Despite the ABV, it drinks like a light beer. It also easily qualifies as a lawnmower beer and a session beer. O'so wasn't kidding when they included the phrase 'a zippy light bodied beer' on the label. Well, except that part about being zippy.\\t\\tThere can't be anything darker than pale or pilsner malt in the house. Sweetness is lacking, bitterness isn't prominent either, and a bit of sourness keeps the taste score from the next highest number. The label also reads 'a lasting impression of sun dappled oranges'. Sorry, I'm not getting that at all. A minor blip of noble hoppiness doesn't do enough.\\t\\tAs previously noted, the mouthfeel is light. It might even qualify as watery on the finish, but that isn't necessarily a sin in a beer that was designed to be consumed during the hot weather months. If it wasn't designed for that purpose, at least that's the task for which it's best suited.\\t\\tThe Big O isn't as exciting (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) as its name would suggest.

I don't know if I could drink more than a couple of these in a sitting though. You can really taste the smoke flavor in there. It pours a pretty dark black (I had it in a backyard past sundown so it was difficult to get a good view) with a light, off white head (I think). The most noticeable thing about this beer is the smoke flavor. It's like inhaling smoke from your BBQ and then taking a drink of a porter. It's pretty smooth and not a lot of carbonation. If you're into the smoked beer thing then I don't see how you could go wrong here. I don't even like smoked beer and still thought this was decent. That's saying something. O'Fallon Brewery is becoming one of my favorites.\",\n",

In fact, I credit this particular brew with igniting my love of great beer. So yes, there is some sentimental value here. I will, though, attempt to review this beer in the most objective way possible.\\t\\tA: The body is a shining, fiery red with honey accents. A bright white head races to the top of the glass and sits beautifully for a few minutes. What lacing is left slides back into the body rather quickly.\\t\\tS: Theres a really strong nose on this one. Fruity hops stand out big time, and the rye is readily apparent as well. Theres the faintest hint of sweet nuttiness/vanilla, too.\\t\\tT: With such boisterous hops in the nose, youd almost expect the palate to be overwhelming bitter. This, however, is not the case whatsoever. The hops and loud but smooth, making this beer excessively drinkable. That familiar rye aroma comes back with a furiously present sour-dough hue that takes the experience to a completely different level. Like any PA worth its salt, light fruits play their part (only minutely, though). A warm, whiskey-like alcohol comes in at the finish to counter the strong bitters, making the aftertaste crisp and modest.\\t\\tM: The micro-carbonation is an added bonus to this already magnificent brew, giving it a bubbly creaminess that is satisfying and drinkable.\\t\\tO: I have a lot of respect for this beer, and I always will. No matter how many PAs I have in my lifetime, I can almost guarantee that this will remain amongst the top spots. I love this beer.',\n",

It is vaguely reminiscent of a Black & Mild; there's some slight vanilla and whispers of stonefruit. Milk chocolate, obviously. Chicory. Some ham, to be quite honest.

Quite the porter indeed. \\t\\tMouthfeel seems solid. The carbonation gives out too soon, which is problematic with the smoke flavor, but a good showing overall.

Redish brown when held in the light. On the table more of a dark brown. Very light head from the poor. Minimal lacing and fingers around edges. So far looks fab. I love the smell of Caramunich malt. Light hop aroma what is there is pleasant and only subtle. Taste is magnificent with very malty taste with caramel. Sweet on the tongue and cheeks but not so much so. The hops really bring out the flavor profile of the grain. Medium to slight thickness in the mouth with little carbonation to tickle the tongue. One of the best bock I have had.',\n",

Head retention is good, with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is raspberries, honey, and red wine. For some reason the aroma reminds me of drinking some Boone's Farm stuff, I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not. Taste is similar to the aroma, but it's more sweet than it is wine-like, although the wine taste is still noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and syrupy. The carbonation is very strong at first, but it does smooth out as the beer warms. Drinkability is decent, a smaller glass of this at BBC wouldn't be bad, but a 750 ml bottle of this is a bit too much for me. I thought this was a decent brew, it's the first Braggot I've tried and I would try one again. I'll have to get this on tap the next time I go to BBC.\",\n",

By the way...I think packing a hop cone (or more than one) in each bottle is really pretty cool...and it must take forever to have to hand pack all of these hops! The brew had some dark chunky sediment, likely a by-product of the hops packaged in the bottle.\\t\\tS - A very sweet hoppy aroma fills my nostrils as I draw in the beautiful bouquet of this brew. The hop aromas take on a very pineapple like scent. I've had this dessert before...that cake that has a layer of pineapples lining one side of it. It smells exactly like that pineapple cake!\\t\\tT & M - Oooh, this is a sweet hoppy mutha! Citric hops (with that same pineapple flavor I smelled) play nicely with a heavy sweet malt base. This is very much on the sweet end of the IIPA scale, but it comes across very nicely. There also seems to be an earthy component in there just to add a bit of complexity. Medium bodied, finishes with a bit of an earthy hop aftertaste. The 9% ABV is actually pretty well hidden.\\t\\tD - A tasty treat that any hop aficionado will surely appreciate. Love the hops packed in the bottle and I hope they never stop doing that, even though it's likely labor intensive. Very nicely done O'so!!\",\n",

The aroma is a little grainy, a little candy sweet, and a little herbal. The flavor has a light and dryly sweet malt base with the distinctly cherry flavor adding both more sweetness but also a bit of tartness that really saves this beer from being too syrupy sweet. The texture has a champagne-like carbonation that adds yet another something different. \\t\\tOverall, this beer tastes as if an old bottle of cherry 7-up got left in a dusty corner of the pantry for a few years only to be discovered by an eleven-year-old boy and his friends while they pretended to be international spies. Still in character, the boy agreed to take a drink from the dusty old bottle because it was the antidote for the neurotoxin he had been given by a double-agent from Algeria. Expecting it to be flat and stale, he was surprised to find that it retained much of its original character, with both a crisp refreshing effervescence and a light sugary sweetness. He also found, however, that the age had done something strange and wonderful by giving it an intriguing tartness and an only barely noticeable fermented kick.\\t\\tThe imaginary antics of a young boy and his friends aside, I found this beer to be a nice change-of-pace that I don't need to have too often but that I would certainly be willing to try again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. The beer pours like jet-black oil out of the bottle. A chocolate colored one-finger head results from the pour. The bubbles in the head are quite large and makes the froth look like what happens after you blow into chocolate milk with a straw. Great retention and lacing.\\t\\tSmell: Toasted malt, chocolate, tobacco, molasses, brown sugar, and coffee are just some of the scents vying for my attention. I would describe the aroma as more bitter than sweet, which I like. The oatmeal is definitely in the background, but not as up-front as the other scents. Could be due to the age of the bottle; I think it's only a couple of months old, so I would be interested to see this thing after several months of aging.\\t\\tTaste: There's definitely substantial body, but not nearly as heavy as I thought it would be, given the oily pour and all. Lots of bitter coffee and tobacco up front. All the elements found in the aroma are there and no one thing is overpowering; however, I fell like a lot of the deeper, sweeter elements aren't as prominent as they were in the smell. Again, probably should have let this one sit a little longer before enjoying.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium to full-bodied, bitter, and delicious. The alcohol is also hidden very well.\\t\\tDrinkability: Goes down fairly easy. I think this particular bottle was a tad green, and many of the bitter characteristics could become a bit persistent after a couple of these.\",\n",

Kinda iffy on the taste but here goes my opinion:\\t\\tAppearance: Dark dark grape color with a pink redish head of maybe 1 finger thickness that goes away pretty quickly. Lacing all around.\\t\\tSmell: Like raspberries. Seriously thuogh its the only thing I could really smell.\\t\\tTaste: Again raspberries. And here's where I have a personal problem with the beer. I haven't tried many fruit beers but I have had maybe like 10 or so and none of them have been SO fruity as this one. I mean you could have honestly put Welch's juice in there and I wouldn't have tasted the difference. Okay I would have but you get what I'm saying. It's very experimental I definitely did not down the entire bottle shared it with a couple of buddies and I'm glad I did, didn't really feel like having more than one cup of this. There's a tiny little hint of bready malt at the end but it makes a very very ephimeral appearance. Poof gone and back to raspberries. \\t\\tMouthfeel is great lots of carbonation, a little sticky, and very easy to drink. You can chug this stuff...wait nvm its 9 percent lol\\t\\tDefinitely surprised me in a very confusing way. I really don't know how I really feel about this beer other than I would never every pay for it again. I'd have a glass if offered to me or something, but seriously if you're going to sip on this just make yourself a raspberry screwdriver and safe yourself some money. Glad I tried it for the novelty but I immediately reached over for some surly furious after this one to get my taste buds out of the raspberry funk they were in. Too much raspberries, could have made it a much more interesting beer. Who knows with so much sugar maybe leaving this one in the cellar might do some kwirky ol things to it.\",\n",

Very burnt dry mouthfeel that is medium with a slight carbonation. Taste is superb with a smoked salmon flavor. Aftertaste lingers, but it is not too dry or harsh. I also recommend this with food. It is not the type to pound 3 or 4 of these. The flavor will over dominate. It did me after one pint. But to pair with fish, pork, and even pasta is fantastic!

When held against the light, little bits of dark dark red was seen around the edges. Little to no lacing on this. When swirled a small mocha head would a appear briefly. \\t\\tS: Strong smell of coffee, bourbon and vanilla. Upon further and deep sniffs of the beer, I got a hint of chocolate mixed in there. Bits of nice malts mixed into that smell as well. The smell of alcohol is prevalent in this one. This smell got my mouth watering.\\t\\tT: Taste of coffee upon the first sips, mixed with vanilla and a good malty backbone taste. The taste of the bourbon comes into play as well. Not overbearing, but a perfect mix in my opinion. After taste was dark chocolates with notes of malt. Very great mix\\t\\tM: Feels great going down, so smooth. Medium bodied with little carbonation. It was what I expected for this type of beer.\\t\\tD: Alcohol is prevalent so it may slow down the drinking a bit. Otherwise, if it wasn't for its 11.20 ABV I would be downing these like no other.\",\n",

It isn't Goose Island Bourbon County or Kentucky Breakfast, but this is a great stout to house back and enjoy every few months/years. Coffee flavours come in with a bit of alcohol warmth and oak. Creamy!\\t\\tMouthfeel- Medium bodied with a slightly acidic aftertaste. Chocolate lingers on the toungue long after first sips are had.\\t\\tDrinkability- A great beer that I could drink until it's too late.

Smells of thoroughly roasted malt; so roasted in fact that there's no real conventional malt taste. It's essentially all bitter coffee with faint chocolate notes. Burnt, bitter flavors dominate the taste with gobs of coffee and some dark cacao. Earthy character with an astringent finish. As hard as it is for an RIS to be unbalanced, this one is; a dry stout beefed up with spent Folger's grinds. It does have a thick feel, but it's too oily to be a real positive. Definitely a sipper. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was disappointing.\",\n",

Nice cream colored head that is still about one finger after several minutes and there's some decent head retention too.\\t\\tNice bready molasses like aroma common for the style, but you also get some hops in the nose as well.\\t\\tVery interesting taste. Not quite as thick as you'd expect for the style, but the additional hops make up for the lack of bready malts. The malts and hops compliment each other very well, making for a unique and tasty lager.\\t\\tMedium mouthfeel. Perhaps a little thin for the style, but that's alright with me. Moderate to low carbonation which suits this beer perfectly. \\t\\tDrinkability is sky-high for the style. I could probably do a sixer on a good day.\\t\\tMorey's Bottom Line: This was not the freshest sample, so I could only imagine how good this beer must be when super fresh. \\t\\tI've been waiting to sample this beer for a LONG time, and I must say, it lived up to my expectations. I'm more of a hoppy ale type of guy...as apposed a thick malty lager type of guy, so this twist on the style works in my favor. Stoudts is an underrated brewery in my opinion. This is one of their best. One of the more creative beers that I've had in a while.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'If you told me three months ago that I would review fifty different beers by June, I would have choked on my Busch Light. Its crazy, but thats just the way it happened. Anyway, I wanted to do something special for this one (even though, yes, I know that number fifty isnt all that big of a milestone). And, thanks to 1Adam12, Im now holding a bottle of Kentucky Breakfast Stout  one of the most beloved American beers ever. Thanks again Adam! You made my first trading experience easy, rewarding, and generally awesome. But enough about us  lets get to the beer:\\t\\tA: As soon as the first drops flowed into my tulip, all I could think of was thick. It poured very slowly, even more than a lot of beers of this style. In fact, it was so syrupy that my girlfriend asked me what I was drinking. Is that really beer? Its funny, because this is what a lot of dark beers should look like, in my opinion: deep brownish-black, thick as hell, with a small but resilient head. I love the bold first impression.\\t\\tS: A dark coffee aroma is striking at first, then it blends peacefully into sugary syrup notes. Theres chocolate, toffee, and a little bit of raspberry, even. The finish on the nose is, not surprisingly, bourbon. Oaky, spicy, smoky bourbon. Overall, a wonderful prelude.\\t\\tT: Oh wow. This is unbelievable. A killer upfront bitterness throttles everything I know about dark, aged beer. Its perfect for a hophead like me. The hops are solidly grounded in a combination of yeast so earthy that it gives the entire palate a rustic footing. Coffee and chocolate grow, as expected, from the dark expanse of the body, with some caramel in between. Great execution  very well balanced. The best part, though, is when the bourbon comes in. I really cant think of any other word but fantastic. Its deep, warming, peppery, and woody. Its never artificial or out-of-place in the palate. The finish brings back that tart raspberry from the nose, coupling with the dryness of everything else to present a satisfying aftertaste that begs for more of the same. This is an experience that will be hard to match. Nothing short of incredible.\\t\\tM: Rich, creamy, thick. This works very well with the palate. However, there is some fizzy carbonation (which seems to be a trademark of Founders) that makes the body just a hair light on occasion. Everything else, though, is golden.\\t\\tO: Four words: This. Beer. Is. Epic. Im glad that I waited for review number fifty to check this one out, because now I can really appreciate how exceedingly complex and satisfying it is. Without a doubt, this has been one of my favorite beer experiences ever. Next year Im grabbing a case.\\t\\tIm so glad that Founders has such high standards. This is the kind of beer that gets me excited to go to the bottle shop. This is kind of beer that puts a smile on my face when I think of my future experiences. And this is the kind of beer that makes me proud to be a part of the craft community.\\t\\tHeres to fifty more like KBS!',\n",

Figs, raisins, brown sugar, caramel and burnt toast come to mind. By far the best beer I have had from the Baltic nations. It is a bit thin and not overly complex, but it is not lacking in flavors and the 8.2% is well hidden. As is warms though, it does get a bit rougher around the edges and mildly boozy. I am thinking this bottle probably has about a year of age on it and seems to have done it some good, however it does not taste like it would age for more than a couple.

       "  'review/text': 'Standard 12oz brown stubby founders bottle into a snifter. It had a bottled on date stamped along the neck but it looks like there was an issue during stamping because it seemingly printed overtop itself and is illegible. This brew appears a fairly clear color of amber orange. Around the thinner edges it takes on more of an orange to lighter yellow hue and through the body a bit of redness. The cap forms more than a finger strong, slightly offwhite. The head displays some pretty solid retention that lasts throughout the entire duration from rising bubbles of carbonation from the etching in the bottom of the glass. Some patches of lace stick to the glassware.\\t\\tThe aroma of this brew is fresh with a citrus hop element that mixes with a lightly dank to grassy and herbal aspect. There is a fairly bold orange pulp to rind aspect throughout which brings on a bit of a sweeter smelling role to the aroma that gives way to faint floral and other fruity notes. As it warms up, it picks up a touch of pine. Overall this is a well put together and complex aroma of primarily hop characteristics. There is a faint amount of grainy sweetness but that hardly plays a role in the big picture.\\t\\tThe taste is bitter and oily with hop resines. It tastes of pine, orange and grapefruit pulp. A little bit of a mineral aspect is evident that gives way to a grassy taste that is somewhat dank as well. The alcohol is fairly evident for 7% abv, it accents a fruity quality throughout the profile mixed with a touch of flowers. There is a toasty grain to almost caramel grain presence but it provides hardly a touch of sweetness to balance out the resiny bitterness of this brew.\\t\\tThis is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. All in all very well balanced and put together. Founders makes a solid line-up of brews straight across the board and this is no exception. Give it a try.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Man, seeing a hoppy beer with a bottled-on date of less than three weeks is awesome. Thankfully, I was able to grab a bottle of this wet-hopped classic, Founders Harvest Ale, right as it was released. To fresh hops!\\t\\tBottled 19 days before the date of this tasting (BOTTLED 09/22/11). Its a beautiful thing.\\t\\tA: This one has classic beauty, starting with its foamy white head; bubbly and smooth, it comes down slow enough to leave lots of spider-web lacing. The body is a serious gold that glimmers with a dark amber shine, matching the lip of my Stella Artois chalice perfectly. Lovely looking brew.\\t\\tS: This is where the stars come out! A hopheads delight, these flowers come off as a dark, resiny, piney masterpiece, only to smacked around by flowery fruit hit soon after. Gooey orange candy, mango, grapefruit, and some delicious caramelized pineapple scents move over a bed of doughy malts that have a slight roast character. Superb!\\t\\tT: Fruity and sweet up front; very smooth sugars. Im feeling mostly citrus, but not in a fresh wayagain, more like candy. Or Jell-O. In any case, it works well with the palate, giving a nice sweet blast of orange, pineapple, and apricot. Before you know it, bitter flowers starting working some tasty pine magic; these hops, nice and quaint, make one instantly of balance. On the contrary, though  I actually would have liked a little more in the bitter department. Soon enough, theres a taste of slightly-kilned malts and light biscuit dough; so light it doesnt even have a hand in the aftertaste. That also might be because the hops are so big in the finish, where dryness is countered only by fruit syrups. Not a super-full experience, but good.\\t\\tM: The extreme bubbliness of this beer keeps it drinkable every time. Light to medium body.\\t\\tO: Best wet-hopped IPA Ive ever had. The nose blew me away, just like with many harvest ales Ive tasted, but the palate was able to back it up this time. To be honest, this beer reminds me a lot of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: clean, hoppy refreshment. This is something I could enjoy for bottles at a time.',\n",

One finger chocolate colored head settles quickly to a thin film that leaves decent lacing.\\t\\tS - Smells almost exactly like I would expect a 2/3 IPA 1/3 Stout. Hoppy and roasty, blended nicely. I know I'm in for a flavorful beer.\\t\\tT - Hoppy up front and then lots of roasty goodness in the middle. Ends with coffee and earthy hops and hangs around on the tongue for a while. Complex and refreshingly unique.\\t\\tM - Pours thick but sips nice. A little sweet but that seems fine for the taste.\\t\\tD - Easily drinkable but a little overwhelming. I might rather a glass of each rather than one mashed together in the black and tan style. Not sure how to rate this considering it isn't really a style but here it goes anyway. Easy to drink but I wouldn't reach for one on a regular basis.\",\n",

First glass is a clear bright orange color, but the second glass from the 750 mL bottle is hazy and opaque with a ton of sediment.

The taste is similar to the smell up front, but it settles down into a dry metallic aftertaste. The lemon taste is a bit too strong up front, and this beer would be more pleasant if the tropical fruits (pineapple, & mango) were stronger.

Heavy on the citrus and hops overall, but without the good fruit esters from the malt backbone, I'm left not necessarily with a one-dimensional aroma, but one that could be much more complex than it is right now. That said, it's strong and pungent and is OK with being an extremely hopped up DIPA, which I suppose it probably should be. \\t\\tTaste: Big hops and a good malt backbone, as I expected. A bit of fruit as it warms up, but mostly candied citrus hops and a ton of nice bitterness on the back end. Finish is more of the candied flavor, along with more malt sweetness, and leafy pungent hops that stay on the tongue. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Big and creamy with good carbonation, the small prickly stuff that ends up working out really well for this type of DIPA. \\t\\tDrinkability: A big one, yes, but one that is highly drinkable and comes recommended.

       "  'review/text': \"On tap at Cannon Brew Pub, 10/18/10.\\t\\tAppearance: Pours a transparent golden orange, sort of the thing one would expect from an IPA, with one finger of nicely proportioned dull white head. The staying power leaves a little to be desired, but it does leave a few dollops of nice creamy lacing and a minor collar, \\t\\tAroma: Subdued but definitely present. A nice leafy and floral hop aroma dominates the a honey-sweet, lightly roasted malt foundation, and a few pleasant acidic hop astringencies add a little depth.\\t\\tTaste: A strongly herbal hop profile on this one, with flourishes of citrus, leafyness, and grassiness coming through at places. The bitterness is moderate, not overpowering by any means, and interacts well with the grassy nature of the hop profile. The maltiness is biscuity, crackery in places, and definitely takes a backseat to the hop show, as it should.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Soft, smooth, and sparsely carbonated, like most of the other beers I've had here at Cannon this evening. This one could probably use a little more carbonation, however, as I actually like what I'm tasting here. Nonetheless, it manages to get the job done, even if it's a little creamier and subdued than I prefer.\\t\\tDrinkability: A beer that was a little more than the sum of its parts, I think. I've had this beer a few times now in Columbus, and I've noticed differences each time I've had it, suggesting that it changes a little from batch to batch. That's a good thing, I think - sort of quaint. At an eminently respectable 4.5%, this one's quite quaffable, too. Recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Edit- second bottle\\tNo date on bottle, but aged at least 3 months (according to the store I bought it from). \\t\\tA- same as below- head is minimal, even if the pour is hard, dissipates quickly with no lacing to speak of. Then again, what are you expecting with an RIS of this kind? For what it is, it is pleasant to look at. \\t\\tS- milder coffee (this is a big difference), vanilla is more present. Bourbon is still a bit lacking (again, my experience is limited). Alcohol tingle is milder upon exhale than a fresh bottle. \\t\\tT- MUCH milder coffee bitterness. Still present, just not overpoweringly acrid and out of balance as in a fresh bottle. Sweetness is more obvious as a result and flavors are more in balance- not particularly chocolate as some might think, but there is a roasted malt sweetness that comes thru. Bitterness is more reserved due to age (drank with smoked fish and fatty foods).\\t\\tM- mild carbonation at this point, smooth, full bodied, but not chewy- still a little slick. \\t\\tOverall, an AGED bottle, even one as few as a couple months, makes a world of difference for me. If you enjoy the coffee flavor, drink it fresh by all means. As for the bourbon/wood flavors, it\\'s still muted, but a bit more pronounced with age as things are more in balance without the coffee overpowering everything. I also drank mine with smoked salmon and eggs, so it was more fitting as a literal \"breakfast\" stout, and the fat perhaps blunted the coffee onslaught. I still don\\'t think this warrants anything near its price, and fresh, I was tempted to toss it outright. \\t\\tNOTE: I can only recommend a few months of aging- accounts from beer buyers at wine shops I frequent have mentioned the flavor being quite bad when past 1 year or close to it. As I have yet to have this experience, I\\'d limit my recommendation for aging to a few months. \\t\\tFirst review 3/23/08\\tbottle from a fresh 4 pack, poured into small tulip, no date.\\t\\tA- opaque dark brown with lighter brown edges against light. head is espresso foam colored, dissipates quickly into thin rim around that leaves surprisingly good initial lace.\\t\\tS- Coffee outright (not espresso, but black coffee). Oak wood/woody smell is also strong (perhaps this is the bourbon wood smell, I\\'m not that familiar with bourbon). Vanilla was apparent when I ATE something with vanilla extract in it (in this case, homemade biscotti), otherwise I can\\'t smell it over the coffee and oakiness. Finishes very coffee in the nose upon exhale, and almost smoky (I assume due to the oak aging).\\t\\tT- Slightly sweet, quickly goes to sharp coffee finish, first sips reveal refreshing hop bitterness- citric in nature, leaving the impression that the beer is drier than it actually is. Both coffee and hops linger to tickle/tingle the mouth a good bit. Really reminds me of a cup of black coffee with a couple sugars in it. I don\\'t know think that\\'s a good thing- more malt and sweetness would have given a better balance, as well as more muted coffee bitterness. \\t\\tM- Smooth, light but sharp carbonation. Surprisingly light in feel in the mouth- not nearly as viscous as one might expect from 10abv. \\t\\tOverall, a nice american double imperial stout, but not the greatest. It has its own particular coffee forward character, but for me, it doesn\\'t warrant such high praise- my own taste leans towards sweeter chocolate stouts (I tasted/smelled very little chocolate in this, despite what others wrote). I do feel the coffee and woody flavor is quite overpowering in comparison to other components- again, more malt and sweetness would offer more balance to this beer. I fear labeling this beer overrated, but on a personal subjective basis, this is not an all timer for me. I do have 4 more bottles to try, so perhaps my view will change, as I think my expectation for something thicker and more sweet may have colored my judgment. In the end, a nice (particularly if you love coffee), but not great beer.',\n",

The head is short-lived and all that remains after 5 or so minutes is a light and delicate lace down the side of the glass. Its taste reminded me much more of a German Pilsner. Its herb like tastes were not as pungent as a German Pils but were noted all the same. This brew has a heavier hop profile as well. I, for one, welcomed this characteristic (God oh how I miss IPAs), it broke the monotony of lightly hopped brews. By no means is this a hoppy brew, just more so than most varities of beer in Europe (including Pilsners). Its mouthfeel seemed a little watery and as the brew does not finish as clearly as other Pils (like Budvar and a few more I cant spell well enough to write) drinkability is not its strongest aspect. All the same one could quaff several of these with little problem, its just that there are more drinkable brews out there. Many would probably beg to differ with me, but that was simply my two cents.\\t\\tAll in all a solid beer and worth a try.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Saw this one sitting on the shelf at the local beer store... I quickly scooped it up because I love Founders and anything Michigan I can find now that I'm stuck in central IL aka the beer void of America. Cool looking label also. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep cloudy yellow color with a slight orange tinge and a HUGE frothy head that sticks around all day. The smell is a huge hit of hops; spicey, citrusy, piney and resinous. There is also a sweet malty backdrop that complements the hops nicely. No solventy alcohol smells. That is one excellent smelling DIPA. The taste only confirms what I thought about the smell, hop bomb but not in an overly bitter, mouth puckering way. All the flavor is there but it lacks that sharp bitterness that turns some people off from huge hoppy beers like this one. The citrusy, piney hops are nicely balanced with a solid backing of slightly sweet maltiness. There is only a hint of alcohol in the finish in a warming characteristic but I would never guess this rings in at 9.4%. The mouthfeel is full bodied and has a velvety smooth carbonation, almost like a nitro tap. Drinkability, considering the high ABV and IBUs is huge. I would drink this all the time if that was an option. I really like Founders in general, but I think this may be my new favorite. Spectacular beer, if you can get your hands on it... buy it!!\",\n",

There were notes of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and maple in the nose. Based on the smell, I was expecting the beer to have a very sweet maple flavor, but I was wrong. While the beer was definitely sweet, the maple flavor was very mild and almost non-existent. It became a little more noticeable as the beer warmed. The dominant flavors initially were the chocolate and coffee, along with some roasted malts.

This years version has more of a hop aroma than I remember it, but they fade as this warms. Some oak/vanilla and dark fruit such as plum. A nice smell of raisins.\\t\\tT- A really nice balance between the sweet malt giving off a bready vibe and dark fruits consisting of mainly dates and raisins. I got some hops on first sips but that faded as I got more into it. The little hint of vanilla is a nice touch. Some alcohol seeps through. Has some vinious hints here and there. Nice.\\t\\tM- A very sweet and thick oily texture while this is somewhere above medium bodied. A bit of hotness from the alcohol but well contained for a near 10% old ale plus fairly fresh. Very faint bitterness from the hops, nothing major. A good one to let marinate on the tounge.\\t\\tD- I usually take my time with big abv beers but this went down without a hitch. The alcohol is barely noticable in taste yet the flavors are just so full this becomes too inviting almost. Not my favorite founders beer but a great stab at the old ale category and worthy for repeat visits and slight aging.',\n",

Finally, some herbal bitterness comes through, and it persists well after I swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is very good, especially given the higher ABV. Really a wonderful beer.

In other words, there isn't much to go on. A hint of musty Euro hoppiness is about it. Almost no alcohol and no overt nastiness are surprising.\\t\\tMissing Elf tastes like every other Euro strong lager that has ever come down the pike. Who knows what the brewers were thinking when they called this beer a Double Bock. Then again, they probably don't subscribe to Beer Advocate style nomenclature.\\t\\tFlavors include barley soaked in grain alcohol and bitter grasses. That's pretty much it. This big lager is close to hot and harsh, but tails off just enough on the finish to avoid offending (if you have a forgiving palate and a strong stomach). Time will probably take the edge off the bitterness and might soften the solvent-like alcohol as well.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is firm (thanks to alpha acids and ethanol), but manages to avoid being ragged or loose. Proper carbonation is the reason why, though it can only do so much.\\t\\tIt's a shame that a picture isn't present as of this review. The label shows Santa nailing a 'Missing Elf' poster on a tree, while the elf in question is wedged between his butt cheeks. Too bad the beer isn't even one-tenth as imaginative.\",\n",

Slightly burnt choco maltiness has a firm grip on the taste buds. Hops give a quick sting of bitterness and an earthy flavor in the middle. Roastiness is well flexed and shows its range, from faint, smoky, charred wood to bitter dark chocolate to over-toasted bread. Some yeast and fruit in the end as well, as a sweetness lifts from the ashes. This Porter means business--one of the best robust Porters around.\",\n",
